    Museum of Visual Culture on the web invites researchers to

    contribute articles to its forthcoming interactive exhibition <a

    href="home.html">Relics & Selves: Iconographies of the National

    in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile (1880-1890)</a>, to be launched in November 2003. Texts can be

    submitted in English, Spanish and Portuguese, and should not

    exceed 6000 words. The articles should have a clear relation to

    the subject of the exhibition and/or the image collection, which

    researchers can browse through at the web address indicated

    above. All papers submitted will be peer-reviewed by

    internationally renowned specialists. Accepted manuscripts will be

    web-edited by curatorial staff of the Iberoamerican Museum,

    i.e. linked to visual and textual sources featured in the

    exhibition, indexed, and cross-referenced to pieces on cognate

    subjects. Texts will appear in the final version of the exhibition

    both in English and Spanish or Portuguese, depending on their

    subject matter.  The Iberoamerican Museum of Visual Culture on the

    web constitutes an experiment in scholarly writing, exploring new

    forms of intertextuality made possible by the Web, to which we are

    bringing scholarly peer review procedures.  Web publication is not

    only instant, interactive and multilayered but will reach beyond

    the bounds of a scholarly journal.  The articles could be read

    thousands of times a day by 'surfing' students and researchers of

    all levels. If you are interested in participating, please send

    your manuscript and a 250 word-abstract to the curators at <a

    href="mailto:ibamuseum@bbk.ac.uk">ibamuseum@bbk.ac.uk</a>.This call does not have a deadline, since web publishing allows for constant revisions and additions to an existing corpus of work. However, contributions will only feature in the exhibition at the time of the launch if manuscripts have been received by 31 July 2003.</td></tr>
