                                <A NAME="N34"></A><A NAME="N35"></A>Rio de Janeiro's National Museum, particularly during the first mid-century of its existence, seems to have served, rather than to produce and instruct a local public in a scientific national pedagogic, to display before foreign visitors -scientists, aristocrats and politicians- not only samples of Brazil's splendid and abundant nature, but also of its capacity to `manufacture&acute; these into museum objects, and thus of the country's claim to modernity and progress. Many of these visitors&acute; accounts are now valuable sources of the museum's early exhibition designs, although many of them are written from a perspective of imperial contempt for the `eclectic&acute; and  `unscientific&acute; choice of exhibits, especially regretting the small number of local objects, and instead the display of ordinary European animal and plant specimens. However, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Denis,%20Ferdinand%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Ferdinand Denis</A>, a romantic French traveller and the author of Brazil's first literary history, <i>R&eacute;sum&eacute; de l&acute;historie litt&eacute;raire du Portugal, suivi du r&eacute;sum&eacute; de l&acute;histoire litt&eacute;raire du Br&eacute;sil</i> (Paris 1826), replied to these complaints: <blockquote>"A certain traveller has observed that at the Museu Nacional of Rio de Janeiro a swan and a robin were being shown. The matter is very simple, and the Brazilians would have a lot to talk about if they noticed all the vulgar birds from their countryside which we conserve in our museums."</blockquote> (Denis cited in Lopes 1996: 71)</P>

Jo&atilde;o VI. In a country whose animal kingdom has been so richly gifted by nature, it was difficult not to look in bewilderment at such a poor assembly of its diverse products; hardly does this collection comprise a quarter of the animals of Brazil. A room dedicated to the Indians and their ornaments offers some interest. However, undoubtedly the most complete part of this establishment is the one destined to the mineral kingdom. It consists mainly of the famous Werner collection, which was bought in Germany and to which some interesting series of Brazilian minerals have been added. The collection of crystallized diamonds is very complete and contains some remarkable forms. Numerous geological series of auriferous and diamantiferous areas would also be worth studying in detail. A monk and scientist, brother Cust&oacute;dio, is in charge of this part of the establishment.</blockquote>

However, these proofs of esteem and courtesy were never returned in due fashion by the North American museums, rich as they may be, to the poor but generous National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. Yes, they were not and that is a shame, and from now on more than enough reasons advise us to abstain from continuing such a  disproportionate relationship.</blockquote> <i>(Netto 1870: 131)</i>

However, this was not the only mischief suffered by the establishment in its relations with foreign collectors and when sending objects abroad in order to figure in foreign international exhibitions. At the Exhibition of Philadelphia, in 1876, we lost many minerals of the collections exposed by the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. At the Chicago Exhibition, many specimens were damaged and, when returned to the Museum, could not be restored anymore. An important collection of Brazilian fossils, sent to the Marquis of Saporta in order to be studied and classified, remained for many years in this palaeontological botanist&acute;s possession, and were lost after his death.</blockquote> <i>(Lacerda 1906: 55)</i>
