Combining these small salaries, he was able to live modestly.  His growing reputation earned him financial greater security when, in 1834, he was appointed professor of natural sciences at the Polytechnical School in Kassel.  Moreover, one of his articles, published on Sicilian molluscs (1836), was awarded a gold medal by Frederick William III of Prussia.  Professional success combined with personal happiness, when he married his cousin Karolina Krumwiede in the same year.  In 1837 a serious illness, not specified in the biographical literature, prompted him to move to Italy, using his wife's inheritance to fund the journey and living costs.  With the family settled in Naples - due to the low cost of living and the ease with which <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Rodolfo</A> could continue to study Sicilian molluscs - Karolina gave birth to their first son, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A> (1838-1910).

His efforts, combined with donations the museum received, soon meant that the museum needed more space than that available in its single room.  The museum was given a larger room in the Palacio de la Intendencia and, in 1866, part of the collection was transferred to the new university site.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Rodolfo</A> was never pleased with having the collection divided between two locations, which caused confusion and allowed for the theft of important artifacts.  In 1876, the entire collection was transferred to the Quinta Normal, its current location, and there <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Rodolfo</A> was given the land to create the botanical garden specified in his original contract.

He had also studied humanities at Hildesheim before the family emigrated.  Arriving in Chile (he was 16 when his father called for the family), <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A> lived on the family's farm with his mother and younger siblings.  The area provided the children with enjoyable opportunities for collecting flora, fauna and archaeological remains.  Over the years, the family modernised production on the farm and continued to search every acre for new specimens of Chilean flora; many of these specimens are still in the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Museo Nacional de Historia Natural</A>.  Using specimens found on the family farm, Federico created his own herbarium and began writing articles for the <i>Anales de la Universidad</i> on these plants and his other interest, insects.  He also began to venture further afield in his explorations: in 1860, he went with his father to the Quebrada de San Ram&oacute;n and his first independent exploration, in 1864, was to the Cordillera Pelada.</P>

With the museum's re-organization in 1889, in which the government mandated that the museum have a curator with three section heads under him, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A> was appointed head of the Botany Section, having been nominated by <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Rodolfo</A>.  This was his first official post within the museum after decades of unofficial work.  In 1897, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Rodolfo</A> turned the entire museum over to his son, who ran it until his own death in 1910.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A> viewed his principal task inside the museum as bettering the section organization, including the never-ending task of creating catalogues of the material.  This work was dramatically interrupted in 1906, when an earthquake damaged the museum building, particularly its northern and southern sides, destroying the collections in those areas.  The morning after the earthquake, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A>, already 68 years old, ignored the building's structural instability and went into the wreckage to salvage what he could.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A> continued to risk himself for the museum, ignoring the tiredness he felt more as he aged, still arriving first in the morning and leaving last in the evening.  Even the day before he died from the combination of a tumor and intestinal complications, he was organising matters in order to present the museum's finances to the government.  Like his father, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico</A> worked for the museum until it was no longer physically possible: together the two men aspired to create a national museum in Chile with an international reputation.
