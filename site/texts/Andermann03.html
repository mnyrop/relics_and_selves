front of a wall covered with paintings -mostly portraits and naval scenes-, and framed by pieces of furniture which, we may guess, would already have been

considered antiques at the time the picture was taken.  There is a sense of home, of private, comfortable intimacy between the central figure and the

objects surrounding it - indeed, had we not known that the image depicts <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Carranza,%20Adolfo%20P.%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://www.argiropolis.com.ar/ameghino/biografias/carra.htm" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Adolfo P.

posing in front of its exhibition opened in 1890, we would have probably suspected a typical <i>belle-&eacute;poque</i> drawing room, a setting which, as Didier Maleuvre has

suggested, is itself tributary to the museum, as <blockquote>"the interior designs itself as a museum of preciousness, in part as a reaction against the deauthentication of object

production and objective experience in the nascent world of commodities and mass consumerism." <i>(Maleuvre 1999: 5)</i>

                                </blockquote>  Why is it that a national institution, rather than

dramatizing through monumental displays the grandiloquent and archaizing kind of national history acted out by armies and crowds, should have taken to a museum

aesthetics which underscored the private, sentimental attachment to past objects so common in homes which have been for generations in one and the same family?

Or, to put it more boldly, why is it that memory rather than history seems to address us from this photograph of the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Hist%f3rico%20Nacional,%20Buenos%20Aires" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">National History Museum</A>?</P>

arriving from overseas, a deeper layer of identity, a mnemonic nationality which aprioristically excluded them altogether from a space of 'true' citizenry no longer defined -as in Sarmiento's <i>Facundo</i> (1845)- in in

terms of <i>civilization</i> but of <i>culture</i>. After 1880 private collectors and family historians were appointed to numerous committees, to advise on the correct

classification and placement of objects, dividing epochs and periods from one another and pointing out the exceptional events that separated them. Selecting and

classifying those family memorabilia was the prime operation of this new kind of national historiography, an operation which, while conceived as the final closure of

the epic history it displayed, was sometimes explicitly compared to this history as a new, though civic and bookish, moment of heroic foundation: one not of

nationality, but of the State as its logical, organic consequence.

the more profane task of creating a genealogy for the progress advertised at the Continental Exhibition. Rather than adopting the heroic rhetoric then common to

historical writing and painting, the show placed emphasis on science, trade and artisan crafts, so as to transmit the impression of an ongoing process of technical

improvement in production and comfort.

                                <BR>In a note from 1879 <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Lamas,%20Andr%e9s" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Lamas</A> proposed to focus attention on the colonial past and the

wars of independence alone: medals, flags, uniforms and coats of arms, as well as copies of the declaration of independence and the national anthem, should sketch a

brief narrative of heroic foundation, thus implicitly suggesting a parallel between the break with the colonial era and State consolidation as a break with the immediate

past of barbarism and civil war. Apparently <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Lamas,%20Andr%e9s" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Lamas</A> considered using this temporary exhibition as a means of gathering material for a national history museum, to be

hosted by the very national government whose historical role this narrative was to celebrate. Having insisted largely on the necessity of a systematic and well

illustrated catalogue, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Lamas,%20Andr%e9s" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Lamas</A> concludes that 

to <blockquote>bring together for the first time, those precious objects now dispersed over the entire territory, and in some localities -as is the case in this very capital- out of the

place which corresponds them, would be to avoid another painful loss and to acquire a most important base for a national institution designed to conserve them with

the veneration they deserve. This concentration, however, can only be effected by the action of national government.<i>(Lamas 1879)</i>

The objects now requested would have considerably broadened the original scope of the show, extending

national historical time both towards the past -with documents recalling the second foundation of Buenos Aires by Juan de Garay in 1580-, and towards the present

-with trophies brought back by the province&acute;s bataillons from the Paraguayan War (1865-1870). In three years of planning, it seems, the initial sketch of a one-act

play on nation foundation spanning across the first two decades of the nineteenth century, had become an epic history and an embryonic museum narrative, stretching

over four centuries.

from a poor response from potential exhibitors of neighbouring countries (some of them deeply involved, by then, in the War of the Pacific), the Exhibition&acute;s fate was

sealed by the turbulences surrounding the presidential election that same year.

'wind of history' which, although blowing not from Paradise but from some dark, archaic region of the national soul, keeps the artisans of progress from putting

together the pieces of a better future materialized in the Palace of the Continental Exhibition: 



<blockquote>It could not have begun under better auspices, but the unforeseen came to disturb everything; and when the square had been sealed, the cement finished, the columns

erected, the framework put together, the armour mounted, and already the great skeleton of the construction gave an idea of what it would be once these bones had

received their skin, colour, and decoration, a gust of wind, of strong, impetuous wind, quick as a ray of lightning and just as brief, destroyed in a minute the work of

so many men and so many days, tearing down, dismantling and crushing, in confused and disorderly turmoil, joists, braces, lathes and suspension cables, thus

inflicting on this place the same thing that the storm does to the savage coast when it hurls the shipwreck against its rocks.<i>(de Garay 1882: 1)

industry.

historical exhibition of military glories, should be evacuated from the Palace that would eventually arise from the ruins of the 1880 uprising. In this critical moment of

consolidation of a centralized State authority the mission of historiography was to confirm the end of history and the country&acute;s entry into the age of politics.<BR>

monumentality imposed on objects by the "museum effect" (Alpers 1991), an image of power capable of evoking the devotional attitude Michael Taussig has so

aptly described as "State fetishism" <i>(Taussig 1993)</i>, here the materials themselves seem to carry the traces of private veneration into museum space. The exhibition at

Calle Moreno certainly did not resemble a pantheon, rather, the bourgeois drawing room provided the model here: the always already false immediacy, the very fa&ccedil;ade

character of these collections of pseudo-aristocratic preciosities, is, of course, precisely one of the most acute and recurring topics of period narratives of crisis, as

in, for instance, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Cambaceres,%20Eugenio%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://168.83.21.26/olimpi97/Literatura-Argentina/Autores/Cambaceres/Cambaceres.htm" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Eugenio Cambaceres</A></A>&acute;s cynical masterpiece <i>Sin rumbo</i> (1885), or <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Martel,%20Juli%e1n%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://www.todo-argentina.net/Literatura_argentina/Biografias_de_literatura/julian_martel/julian_martel.htm" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Juli&aacute;n Martel</A></A>&acute;s <i>La Bolsa</i> (1889), both written only a few years before <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Hist%f3rico%20Nacional,%20Buenos%20Aires" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">the

into one, or rather, the relation between the object and its contemplation occured in the private time of memory rather than in the public one of history. The historical

time of nationality should precisely have provided the antidote for this apparent decay of memorial time; yet, fatally, the museum founded to that effect seemed

incapable, or unwilling, of making the leap from accumulation to narrative: <blockquote>My mission <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Carranza,%20Adolfo%20P."

                                <BR>One of the earliest photographs of the exhibition at Parque Lezama, dating from the turn of the century, illustrates the use made of the additional space now available:

commanded into line, with the visitor parading, as in a military inspection, along the large middle corridor. In the old building, due in part to the lack of

space to create distance and detach viewers from objects, an all too explicit private intimacy with the past had ruled; in the splendid new mansion&acute;s long and linear

galleries, the distance is almost as great as to give the impression of memories of another country parading along the walls. The result looks preliminary, and it is only

in the space of a text, that a discursive dimension is imposed onto the strangely vague order of display. Following the removal of the collections to Parque Lezama,

                                <BR>As it finally returns, now conscious and deliberately, to its more

intimate model, the bourgeois interior, the museum -now transformed into a monumental death-chamber of absent founding fathers- captures a vanishing history by

eternalizing this very moment of vanishing and thus prolonging it into eternity. It is, we might conclude, not in the first place the objects which are being fetishized here

by the museum form, but the museum form that is objectified, through the use of objects which are in themselves ephemeral, as an icon of the State.
