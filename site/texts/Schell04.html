Although not formally founded until 1838, many accounts root the museum in the independence period because, in 1813 with the ink on the declaration of independence barely dry, the Senate's executive committee voted to found a national museum at the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Universidad%20de%20San%20Felipe,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Universidad de San Felipe</i></A>, as well as create the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Instituto%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Instituto Nacional</i></A>, the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Biblioteca%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Biblioteca Nacional</i></A> and a botanical garden.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Velasco,%20Manuel" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Manuel Velasco</A> was to be the director of the new museum, the collection of which was based on an already-existing mineral display.  Even though <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> was not able to maintain its independence and records do not indicate that the museum ever existed, the later status of the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo Nacional</i></A> stems in part from its links to this early stage of nation formation: the older the museum, the longer the official patronage of natural science.  In the second attempt to start a science museum, Supreme Director <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/military/O'Higgins,%20Bernardo" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Bernardo O'Higgins</A> appointed <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Lavaysse,%20Juan%20Jos%e9%20Dauxion%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Juan Jos&eacute; Dauxion Lavaysse</A> to found and direct a national museum, ordering him to explore the national territory in order to investigate possibilities for foreign colonisation and to propose improvements to transit.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Lavaysse,%20Juan%20Jos%e9%20Dauxion%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Lavaysse</A>, an adventurer who impressed Chileans with his wide but superficial knowledge, never made the assigned journey or founded the museum.  It was finally begun because of the travels and collecting of the French naturalist, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://icarito.tercera.cl/biografias/1831-1861/bios/gay.htm" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Claudio Gay</A></A> , working under contract to the Chilean government between 1830-1833.</P>

	<A NAME="N130"></A>Again, histories of the museum point out that the Chilean government, due to its investment in scientific inquiry, offered <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A> a contract.  Nonetheless, historian Ernesto Greve cites primary sources proving that the contract between the naturalist and the government was actually at <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A>'s initiative.  Already a naturalist, he had come to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> because, while working as a professor in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A>, he could spend his free time exploring and mapping the nearby region.  He sought outside funding for his personal interests because the <i>colegio</i>, barely able to pay the costs of his local trips, would not be able to help him travel further afield.  When he wrote to the government, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A> already viewed his project as one of mapping and collecting throughout the nation; he wrote that he had finished explorations around <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A> and did not want to abandon a work of genuine value.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A> suggested that, if the government were to contract him for further explorations, the resulting texts - to be published in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/other/Europe" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Europe</A> - would address natural history, geology, physical and descriptive geography and statistics of the nation.  In addition, he would create a cabinet of curiosities, paying particularly attention to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s flora and minerals.  He wrote that he did not want a large salary, but only his costs and the protection of local authorities.  He would leave his library (400 volumes) as collateral while he explored and mapped territory which <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> claimed as its own.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A>'s offer could not have come at a better time, because the government perceived European explorations in the south as a territorial threat which needed to be countered with its own scientific expedition.  After three years of explorations, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A> gathered, for display in this 'cabinet of curiosities', plants, animals, mineral samples and evidence of indigenous material culture.  Upon his return to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/France" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">France</A> in 1842, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Gay,%20Claude" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Gay</A> began work on his 24 volume and 2 atlas <i>Historia F&iacute;sica y Pol&iacute;tica de Chile</i>.<BR>

The naturalist only needs to <i>look</i> at the territory to do his work.  Second, he assumes that these lands were somehow 'virgin', waiting to be explored, ignoring the fact that the mountains had been crisscrossed for thousands of years.

In 1878, it was almost entirely composed of skeletons assembled and displayed throughout the museum.  The skeleton collection even included humans: one cabinet displayed the skeletons of 'our perfect and wise human species'. <i>(<i>Guia del Museo... de 1878</i>: 17)</i>  By 1897, the collection had shifted away from skeletons and towards stuffed and preserved animals, perhaps made possible through advances in taxidermy techniques.  One of the museum's first taxidermists, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Landbeck,%20Luis" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Luis Landbeck</A>, an immigrant to the German colonies in the south, lost his sight due to constant work with arsenic, a compound essential in preservation work at that time.  The 1897 museum guide began with a description of modern taxidermy techniques, discussing how the museum preserved its creatures.  This lengthy discussion suggests not only the pride of the institution in its uses of modern technologies, but can also be explained by the fact that the museum's taxidermist wrote the guide in question.  When most of the animals displayed were stuffed, the most important remaining skeleton was that of a whale, which had washed up on the shores of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Valpara%edso" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Valpara&iacute;so</A>.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Albert,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Federico Albert</A>, the guide's author, offered visitors a detailed description of the particular whale, but also what whales were - that they breathed air, yet lived in water.

The existence of these museum guides indicates some concern for public visits to the museum and the public's ability to understand the collection.  Yet overall, the dissemination of scientific information to the wider public appears to have been of little importance to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">RA Philippi</A>.  While he used public access as an excuse for requesting extra financial support, in his regular correspondence and annual reports he rarely offered details of who attended the museum and why.  The museum's goals were the creation of a complete collection of things Chilean, not public education, and it was not until 1911 that the institution clearly define its role vis-&agrave;-vis the public.  In 1911, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Moore,%20Eduardo" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Eduardo Moore</A>, the new curator, defined the museum as dedicated to <blockquote>preserving samples of the fauna, flora and soil of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> and abroad, showing to the public two times a week, Thursday and Sunday in the afternoon.  It serves the teaching of students from schools and the scientific investigation of those who dedicate themselves to science [sic]. Additionally, free consultations are given to industrialists who go to ask for information, above all in the Geology Section. <i>(Moore <i>Bolet&iacute;n</i> 1911: 207-8)</i>

<A NAME="N1506"></A>Knowing that the public was little considered at the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo Nacional</i></A>, we can still glean some information about the visitors.  In the museum's various locations in the city centre, visitors had included students who went to do research and the curious, who were drawn to the animal and human oddities on display.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">RA Philippi</A> remarked disparagingly about the interest that women visitors had in these curios.  When the museum moved to the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/other/Quinta%20Normal%20de%20Agricultura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Quinta Normal</i></A>, the curious continued to attend but numbers fell among those who used the collection as an intellectual resource.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Philippi</A> blamed the attendance drop on the distance from the centre and the cost, in terms of time and money, of making the journey.  Eventually, attendance began to climb again and by 1883, attendance numbers were again pleasing to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Philippi</A>.  On one holiday, 2,000 people visited the museum, while on a regular Thursday the number was 900.  At this point, the museum was only open on Thursday and holidays and <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Philippi</A>, in response to complaints from 'working people', noted that the museum should be open on Sunday, too.  The following year, the museum added Sunday afternoons to its regular open times.  In 1887, the opening hours were increased substantially, to Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday from noon until six in the afternoon.  The change in hours was decreed by the Minister of Public Instruction, but it is not clear who actually pushed for their expansion.  Still we know that by 1911, the hours had been reduced as the museum was only open two days a week, even when if one of its stated roles was public display.</P>

	Short public hours and lack of surviving information about visitors to the museum demonstrate that the institution itself was principally engaged in the manufacture of scientific knowledge and the dissemination of this knowledge to a select group of educated professionals around the world.  While the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo Nacional</i></A> was clearly the result of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Philippi,%20Rodolfo%20Amando" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Philippi</A>'s half a lifetime of service, examination of the collection built also makes clear that the creation of natural history took place as a collaborative enterprise, which required donations from interested individuals and exchanges with museums and scientists all over the world.  The museum, simultaneously isolated from the general public and linked to like institutions internationally, became an important means to prove <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s status as a modern, progressive, scientific nation on the trajectory leading towards a European future.
