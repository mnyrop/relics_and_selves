Many of these were not only travelling naturalists but, in addition, held positions as sectional directors or subdirectors, even though sometimes they lived in the immigrant communities of the South and only occasionally visited the museum. As Maria Margaret Lopes points out, <blockquote>these latter naturalists, in contrast to the majority of their predecessors, were not travellers any more. The built their professional careers at the museum. Generally they arrived here for this very purpose, albeit continuing to send collections and publications abroad. Once they had settled in Brazil, however, they would eventually found their own institutions and museums. And, once they had arrived in their own institutions, they would try to implement their own scientific conceptions, most of which rather than continuing the naturalist tradition of the Museu Nacional, were profoundly marked by the breakup between the model of the General Metropolitan Museum incarnated by the Museu Nacional, and the provincial models of ever more highly specialized museums that emerged during the last decades of the century, precisely in opposition to the old imperial museum.</blockquote> <i>(Lopes 1996: 65)</i>

In response to Netto&acute;s `autocratic&acute; measures, M&uuml;ller, Ihering, Derby and Emil Goeldi, as well as the naturalists Wilhelm Schwacke and Lacerda, resigned in protest from their posts and, even though Netto, who suffered a stroke in 1891, resigned from his post the year after, most foreign scientists had by then followed Ihering and Goeldi to set up new institutions at Bel&eacute;m and S&atilde;o Paulo (the Museu Paraense, directed by Goeldi from 1894 to 1907; and the Museu Paulista, directed by Ihering between 1895 and 1915). <BR>
