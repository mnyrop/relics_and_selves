	Nineteenth-century Chile produced great historians, who easily passed from the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Biblioteca%20Nacional,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Biblioteca Nacional</i></A> in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A> or the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Archivo%20de%20las%20Indias,%20Seville" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Archivo de las Indias</i></A> in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Sevilla" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Seville</A> to national politics and international diplomacy.  Because of the quality and quantity of historical writing, as well as the political prominence of many historians, modern scholars have suggested that history was given a place of honour in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s culture environment.  However high history's esteem may have been, it did not translate into a stable historical museum, several attempts to found one notwithstanding.  Moreover, the majority of historians themselves stayed away from representing history as material culture preserved for the public memory.  This essay discusses the various museums and displays of historical content in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A> during the late nineteenth century, with a view to understanding what constituted Chilean history and why history museums did not stand time's harsh examination.

                                <A NAME="N74"></A><A NAME="N75"></A>In order to collect items for a museum of history, a consensus needed to be reached on what items of material culture have or can be given value and what will foster sentiments of patriotism and nationalism.  Museums create the heritage necessary to provide the longevity of historical experiences required of nations.  Each 'thing' had to be invested with meaning, and its placement in the rarefied, quiet, solitude of the museum began the process of making an item into a relic of the nation.  Certainly <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> had particular items that were invested with the hopes and history of the nation, but during the nineteenth century their shrines were temporary.

'An exhibition that would inspire, if not liking and affection, respect at least for the objects which have characterised the diverse phases of our society'.  Furthermore, it was unquestionable that 



<blockquote>the search [for], classification [of] and wise and rational comments on the material vestiges which come to one epoch from another, is one of the most accurate and brilliant guides that can accompany the philosopher and the historian in their businesses... the indigenous civilization of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/other/America" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">America</A> has been uncovered and reconstructed through excavating its utensils and gods.  [These items] demonstrate how admirable was the progress of a nation and how rudimentary was that of a neighbour through these examples of their industry, their religion and their domestic arts. <i>(Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna 1872-1873: 346)</i>

                                </blockquote>



For <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a Makenna</A>, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> was a nation rooted in a Hispanic past - a past rich with culture and value.  Display of this past would demonstrate to visitors that great progress had been made in little time.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> had been a poor colony of territory held for military purposes.  Yet, in the creation of the new nation, too much of the past had been sacrificed.  As he wrote to the exhibition president, he knew 'how many precious relics of art the colonial epoch has left us and with what speed the few objects of use are dispersed to the four winds of scorn...'  He continued writing that, <blockquote>the habitual indifference of our race and the indifference for the old have produced in our habits the speed of political and social movements, charged with, in the space of half a century since 1820, putting a new people where before had existed another completely different. <i>(Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna 1872-1873: 342-3)  </i>

                                </blockquote>  Implicit in his desire to display colonial material culture was a criticism of the image of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> as a nation without a past.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a</A> believed that the past served both as a yard stick and a pedological tool.  His respect for the Hispanic roots of Chilean society contrasted with the tendency among Chile's elite to emulate French and English economics and culture.  Moreover, his respect for the colonial past was singular when other public figures, like <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Blest%20Gana,%20Alberto" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://icarito.tercera.cl/biografias/1861-1891/bios/blest.htm" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Alberto Blest Gana</A></A>, historian, novelist and former ambassador to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/France" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">France</A>, who believed that 'cultural vestiges of colonial life were inhibiting <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s material and political strides'.  <i>(Blest Gana quoted in Sommer 1991: 248)</i>  Perhaps historians' general lack of interest in public history was due to their deprecation of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s colonial past.  For them, that past was a legacy which hindered progress, while for <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna</A> it was a means to demonstrate the progress undertaken since Independence.

                                <A NAME="N248"></A><A NAME="N249"></A>The organization of the exhibition fell to a committee among whose duties were included collecting items of interest for display.  Committee members, including General <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/military/Maturana,%20Marcos" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Marcos Maturana</A> and <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/artist/Subercaseaux,%20Ram%f3n" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://www.artephilips.cl/autores/rsuberca.htm" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Ram&oacute;n Subercaseaux</A></A>, gathered together religious artifacts, domestic items, carriages, jewelry, pre-Colombian artifacts, genealogical items and firearms.  These wealthy men rifled through their own collections for material to offer and then, in each provincial capital, enlisted the mayor and local citizens to find materials.  The exhibition president, Eyzaguirre, himself came from 'an old and distinguished family' and called upon relatives and intimates to contribute material.  The display was one of family items, like the portraits that were 'objects of affection and cherished relics from home'. <i>(<i>El Ferrocarril</i> 18 Sept. 1873: 3)</i>  As the elite were  related to each other by blood or marriage alliance, the exhibition really was one of a domestic interior.

                                <A NAME="N277"></A><A NAME="N278"></A>The committee was not bringing together disparate objects to create a collection, rather it was reconstructing something shattered by time.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna</A>, using language that would have resonated with modern men of the nineteenth century, compared their work to scientific investigation:  



<blockquote>As the naturalist who, with the mutilated remains reduced to dust and the fragments of beings that belonged to other epochs... is able to, with wisdom and patience, reconstruct a perfect skeleton and deduce from... these bones the organic life... and even including the peaceful or ferocious habits of the beast to whom [the bones] belonged, like this we could resuscitate the colonial era with its narrowness and its generous opulence, its moral nostalgia and its poverty of means, and exhibit its skeleton dressed in its own, rich finery and deteriorating rags before the light of civilization which today revitalises us and increases our stature.  <i>(Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna 1872-1873: 343)</i>

                                </blockquote>



As scientists, then, these historians made sense of colonial relics by removing them from cluttered domestic spaces to order and exhibit them.  Moreover, like the naturalists or anthropologists he admired, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna</A> was willing to include indigenous artifacts pre-dating the conquest as long as 'the authenticity of their origin is confirmed' <i>(Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna 1872-1873: 343)</i>  This language of science sprang from the social and economic prestige of positivism and the conviction that all societal problems could be resolved if only approached from a scientific perspective.  The urban elite, whose support <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna</A> needed to make the exhibition a success, were among the most enthusiastic proponents of positivism, among other French social and cultural imports.

Visitors to the exhibit were engaged in tourism of the past.  Tickets to the event were sold in an imported carriage, staffed by a 'legitimate black man from Lima' <i>(<i>Cat&aacute;logo de la Esposicion del Coloniaje</i> 1873: v)</i> who also acted as a guide.    Importing a man of African ancestry simultaneously distanced <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> from <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/other/Africa" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Africa</A> and its own slave-owning past while associating <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Peru" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Peru</A> with racial mixing and the assumptions of barbarity therein included.  Other witnesses to history present at the exhibition were survivors from the battles of Independence on hand to regale their juniors with stories of bravery and heroism, while showing off their wounds and their medals.

Nonetheless, exhibitors worried about the 'unwashed'.  For instance, when particular jewels were to be displayed precautions were taken against 'hands that [are] too profane'. <i>(<i>El Mercurio</i> 23 Sept. 1873: 2)</i>    <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna</A>, however, sought both the high and the low of the capital as visitors.  His expectation was that 'sufficient number of valuable garments' would capture the 'informed attention of people of study and wake up the vulgar [person's] appetite for the curious'. <i>(Vicu&ntilde;a Mackenna 1872-1873: 347)</i>   Thus, the exhibition was to be an integrated social space, as were museums in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/other/Europe" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Europe</A> at that time.

There is little indication that museums in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> intended as a whole to serve this moralizing function, but certainly some exhibitions, including the colonial one, did.  At the same time, the exhibition was also to be a place of study and research, not just a space where the 'vulgar' would be entertained by looking at old people's scars.</P>

The catalogue did more than guide visitors from room to room, but attempted to situate the artifacts inside their historic context through descriptions of an item's past.  In fact, the catalogue was supposed to become a historical document in its own right, allowing study of the colonial era in 'its deepest core, in its densest darkness'.  At the same time, the introduction to the catalogue is deliberately playful and invites visitors to suspend their disbelief for the duration of their visit.  The introduction ends: <blockquote>As we have promised to be discrete... here we stop and we leave the curious gentleman and discrete lady to wander among the two thousand plus objects reunited to celebrate the "good times of Chile" with a dance of... silk stockings and short pants. <i>(Cat&aacute;logo de la Esposicion del Coloniaje 1873: vii)</i>

                                <A NAME="N618"></A><A NAME="N619"></A>For all of its levity in presentation, the exhibition depicted nationhood as the fulfillment of a colonial project, while glorifying the present and reinforcing class distinctions.  For the elite, the exhibition was a public display of personal wealth and illustrious ancestry.  Their furniture and paintings had been re-conceptualised as national treasures.  The exhibition also brought the populace into the parlor, to view the luxuries of a past civilization that they could claim as their own now that it was national heritage.  Class divisions were naturalised and given the weight of historical precedent through comparison between the material culture of the elite and the poor.  Gender distinctions were also reinforced, as all things 'feminine' were grouped into one room: the 'bazaar of the charitable societies, that is, the exposition of beauty, grace and charity'.  In one sentence, the catalogue summed up what it was to be a Chilean - and elite - woman: generous, beautiful, graceful and separated from the public world of politics and history.  The growing public role of middle-class women had no place in the exhibition and their advancement was certainly not used as a measure of female progress.  Women's increasing role had no representation in the colonial exhibition.  Although part of society, women remained in their separate sphere.  For instance, the hall contained 'all the objects agreeable to women, and as a consequence, there are also objects agreeable to men' like precious jewels.  The same hall was honoured with the presence of ladies from the charitable institutions of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A>.  There, society's prettiest eligible girls and most elegant married women sold hot punch, waffles, alfajores and chocolate - food from colonial times available at 'moderate' prices.  The proceeds went to benefit the poor.  <i>(Cat&aacute;logo de la Esposicion del Coloniaje 1873: vi)</i>

As Ricardo Krebs notes, throughout the nineteenth century, each generation of Chileans had its war.

The catalogue, more dismissive than descriptive, nonetheless provides some important clues to the collection.  The 'presidents' of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> were part of the governors' series that <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Vicu%f1a%20Mackenna,%20Benjam%edn" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Vicu&ntilde;a</A> had commissioned for the 1873 exhibition.

The rest of the items are of uncertain precedence.  None of the portraits mentioned, however, specifically represented 'Chileans', rather the subjects were Spanish, Italian, French or Araucanian.

                                <A NAME="N1392"></A><A NAME="N1393"></A>Two decades were to pass before evidence of another military museum emerges.  A 1909 catalogue attests to the existence of another military museum.  The collection discussed in the catalogue repeats the list of the flags and guns displayed in earlier exhibitions.  Some of the items, such as Spanish flags which had been housed in the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/military/Museo%20de%20Armas%20Antiguas,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo de Armas Antiguas</i></A>, were in fact taken from the earlier museums.  The catalogue offers the history of each flag, which then becomes a means to discuss modern Chilean history.  For instance, one battalion - Buim 1o de Unea -<blockquote>contributed to the formation of the forts and roads along the Malleco line, including the complete pacification of the Araucanians, where now are shown off the thriving provinces of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/region/Malleco,%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Malleco</A> and <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/region/Cautin,%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Cautin</A><i>(Cat&aacute;logo del Museo Military de Chile 1909: 13)</i>.</blockquote>    Another battalion, during the battle of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/region/Tarapac%e1,%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Tarapac&aacute;</A> in the War of the Pacific, <blockquote>was completely annihilated, losing their standard that remained buried under a mountain of cadavers including their brave commander... this standard which shows 31 bullet holes, was found... in the Church of San Ramon de Tacna, after the battle of the same name, and was solemnly turned over in a military parade of the whole Chilean army, in the Lurin camp.<i>(<i>Cat&aacute;logo del Museo Military de Chile 1909</i>: 14)</i> </blockquote>    This standard had been left for dead with the dead, captured by the enemy and then rescued by its rightful possessors to be taken back in glory to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>.

                                <A NAME="N1449"></A><A NAME="N1450"></A>Many of the standards in the museum had been used until the civil war of 1891.  Standards that represented battalions on both sides of the war were united in the museum - a healing of old wounds that Benedict Anderson rightly points out is essential in national history.  Anderson calls this uniting of the victors and the defeated, or the victims and the assassins, a 'family history' created through strategic forgetting and remembering.  The bloody war is forgotten as 'civil' and instead it is remembered as a family squabble which time has smoothed over.  <i>(Anderson: 1991)  </i>Nonetheless, the standards themselves represented dead battalions, for those battalions that had remained loyal to the president were disbanded after the civil war.  They, too, had been conquered, like the Spanish and the Araucanians.</P>
