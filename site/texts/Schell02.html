				In 1872, <i>El Mercurio</i> reported on an

				  argument among a group of young people regarding the inclusion of nudes in the

				  fine arts section of the National Exhibition of the same

				  year. As the argument progressed it became clear that the group

				was evenly divided into those who wanted the art taken down in the name of

				decency and those who believed the works could not damage innocence, as high

				art elevated one's thoughts. With opinion evenly divided, a young woman

				interjected that the painting that <i>really</i> ought to be taken down was

				a still-life of a watermelon. The still-life depicted an open

				melon, with one slice ready to be devoured and the knife still there, as if to

				cut another piece. The painting inspired strong cravings, particularly

				dangerous to pregnant women, and the young woman remarked that 'it is a

				cruel act to have put this temptation [in the exhibition]'. All present

				could agree that the watermelon had to go. <i>(<i>El Mercurio</i> 30 Sept.

				1872: 3)</i> 

				This light anecdote demonstrates to us

				  perspectives on fine arts in late nineteenth-century <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>. For artists, collectors and critics, high

				art was every bit as crucial for national development as a sound economy: their

				debates about art maintained a serious tone. For others, probably including

				editorial staff at <i>El

				Mercurio</i>, art was a luxury without a role to play in national

				development, which did not merit government support and had no relation to

				everyday life. Aware of these incompatible opinions about fine art, artists and

				some elite citizens together set out to convince the oligarchic

				government, which had minimal interest in promoting art, and to a

				lesser extent the public, that high art was a key component in

				national development. For this group of patrons and producers,

				art was not only inherently uplifting but also a powerful cultural commodity.

				Thus the development of fine arts in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>, and

				particularly the creation of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A>'s art museum</A>, resulted from

				the work of elite art patrons and the artists themselves. This

				article discusses the development of fine arts in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>, examining the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo Nacional de Pintura</i></A> and various

				public exhibitions as part of an elite project of nation-building, which sought

				to expand the audience for and interest in high art.</P>

				the time of Independence, Chilean elites had

				little interest in fine arts and less experience of contemporary European high

				art. 

				By the1840s, national art had gained a

				  more prominent profile. Two methods were employed to foster domestic

				art: the painting academy and periodic exhibitions. 

				The <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Academia%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i><A HREF="http://www.mnba.cl/artistas.nsf/ListaGeneraciones/ESCUELA DE BELLAS ARTES?OpenDocument" CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" STYLE="color:#660000; text-decoration: underline">Academia de Pintura</A></i></A> itself was founded in

				neo-classical painters. The academy's students formed the first group of

				Chilean artists with European training and the works they produced helped to

				create a domestic art market. Exhibitions nevertheless were the principle

				vehicle for creating interest in and demand for fine arts while also

				cultivating artistic taste in the European mould. 

				Occasional exhibitions in the 1840s had

				  evolved (by 1850) into annual events used to demonstrate the fruits of

				  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s progress and to stimulate

				  'hard-working' artisans. <i>(Rodr&iacute;guez Villegas

				Although out of fashion during the

				  1860s,

				  during the 1870s, mostly thanks to historian and mayor of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Santiago</A>

                                </blockquote>.  The

				exhibition prompted other polemics, about what was and was not appropriate for

				display. Although the controversy surrounding nudes in high art was the

				'topic of the day', <i>(<i>El Mercurio</i> 30 Sept. 1872: 3)</i>

				the works themselves remained. At the closing ceremonies, the

				<i>Mercurio</i>'s reporter

				noted that, <blockquote>the point at which the addresses of <i>Se&ntilde;ores</i> 

				Estrada and 

				Matte produced an interruption of applause and

				emotion, was when they spoke of the nude statues and paintings, as if [those

				present were] applauding the nerve that, in spite of the scrupulous people, art

				had in exhibiting nude beauty barely veiled by innocence <i>(<i>El

				Mercurio</i> 7 oct. 1872: 2)</i>

                                </blockquote>.  The exhibition of nudes was a triumph of

				artistic values over misplaced concern for morals.</P>

				itself but in the half-light of the study or office, as it is the companion of

				retreat and the confidant of the solitary, tranquil meditation.</blockquote> Although

				only tangible division between the elites and the rest of

				the population. Culture, manifest through clothing, housing, food or

				leisure-time activities, served to separate the elite from

				the masses. Thinking of culture as a means to differentiate

				classes also helps explain why the museum was not accessible to the

				general public. The elites were not yet concerned with

				working-class moralization, but rather with demonstrating their

				own superiority. 

				During the 1880s, most of the Chilean

				  elite were blind to the social question which had begun to fester

				  around them and, as such, the benefits of pre-emptive disciplining of

				  the working class through moralization had yet to be

				  understood. The isolation of the elites who ran the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">new

				On one occasion in 1887, they decided to sell

				  paintings 'lacking artistic merit' and to use their earnings to purchase better

				  quality ones. The works acquired, while no doubt meeting their high

				artistic standards, were a mixture of genres, ranging from historical themes to

				landscapes and sculpture. Several important historical works were acquired at

				this time. 

				In 1888, the commission asked

				  the government to purchase two

				had trained at home initially, who made a living wholly by painting. Moreover,

				At the national exhibition of the same year,

				From 1885, the

				  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo Nacional de Pintura</i></A> and

				  the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/socialcultural/Sociedad%20An%f3nima%20Uni%f3n%20Art%edstica,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Sociedad An&oacute;nima Uni&oacute;n

				  Art&iacute;stica</i></A> sponsored annual exhibitions of Chilean art,

				  known as salons, after the French

				  institution. The salons charged an entrance fee

				and profits went towards the construction of the Parthenon (including paying

				back the government loan) while also allowing the society to purchase art for

				the museum. The regulations of the salon stipulated that once a week, at the

				discretion of the Directive Committee, the exhibition had to be free to

				everyone. The Directive Committee also had the authority to set the hours and

				the fee for the event. (The artists themselves were always to have free entry).

				The regulations stipulated that all original art executed in

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> and all works by Chilean artists resident

				abroad were eligible for the salons. The awards jury was to be named by the

				museum's <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/socialcultural/Comisi%f3n%20de%20Bellas%20Artes,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Comisi&oacute;n de Bellas Artes</i></A> and

				comprised of three from among their own members and four chosen from

				suggestions of the displaying artists. Art exhibited could win awards in either

				the salons or the 

				General Marcos Maturana Contest, running

				simultaneously. Overall, there was to be a <blockquote>a grand prize of honour, that

				can be awarded to the most outstanding and most important work, either in the

				category of painting or sculpture, only requiring that it has been executed in

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> and by a Chilean artist. <i>(<i>Reglamento para la Esposici&oacute;n Nacional</i> 1887: 5)</i>

                                </blockquote>

				 This

				award winning work could be from any genre; no art or genre of painting was

				privileged over another. </P>

			 <P>

                                <A NAME="N2061"></A><A NAME="N2062"></A>When the salons were opened, only 'fine arts' were eligible

				for display. 

				In 1887, the salon, open to the public each

				  afternoon, displayed 92 paintings, 14 drawings and 10 sculptures. Over

				the years, watercolours, architecture and engravings were added as eligible

				categories. In 1906 the categories of wood engraving and carving were also

				included for display. 

				By 1907, the exhibition included 'works of

				  painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture and arts applied to

				  industry'. <i>(1907 Salon Catalogue)</i> Entries under the

				category of applied art included a table, a

				crucifix, a display cabinet showing Chilean

				porcelain, a Spanish crest, a vase

				and a frame. The gradual expansion of materials eligible for

				display suggests that the strict division between applied and 'fine' arts, part

				of the doctrine taught at the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Academia%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Painting Academy</A>, was either loosening or had

				never really taken hold at all. Fine and applied arts appear to have been

				converging through their joint display at the salons.</P>

			 <P>

                                <A NAME="N2107"></A><A NAME="N2108"></A>Nonetheless, the important awards, like the 

				Maturana and 

				Edwards awards, were only offered to fine arts. 

				The 

				  Edwards Award, created in 1888, provides

				further evidence that there was concern with the overall development of Chilean

				art. Only Chileans resident in <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> were eligible to compete for the 

				Edwards Award, creating an exclusive vision of

				'Chilean' art which 

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Edwards,%20Arturo%20M." TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Edwards</A> shared with 

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/military/Maturana,%20Marcos" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Maturana</A>. Chileans wandering in

				self-imposed exile could no longer gain glory at home. The best

				landscape or still life would be awarded $300, while portraits, animals or

				busts would win $400. Eight hundred pesos was to be awarded to a 'historical

				national painting or a statue or sculptural composition in high or low relief

				about a national theme'. The best overall work, regardless of its genre,

				was given a prize of $1,000. If two works were equally deserving of the grand

				prize, then the recompense could be divided. <i>(1894 Salon Catalogue:

				38-9)</i> The division of prize money suggests that 

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Edwards,%20Arturo%20M." TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Edwards</A> imposed a hierarchy of art, topped with

				art to glorify the nation at the pinnacle. The $800 award is the first evidence

				I have found of a strong incentive for artists to paint national or historic

				themes.</P>

			 <P>

                                <A NAME="N2153"></A><A NAME="N2154"></A>The project of creating artistic taste and spaces for

				artistic exhibition was one principally undertaken by those involved in the art

				world and sympathetic elites. The <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Museo Nacional de Pintura</i></A> resulted from

				the initiative of private citizens, artists and art aficionados, who viewed

				fine arts as a means to rank <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A> among the

				first nations of the world. While the government cooperated with this

				enterprise, it did not foster its own initiatives. Inside the museum, the

				collection of art represented an eclectic mixture of Chilean originals, copies

				of old masters and more recent purchases made in Europe and at home.

				Philanthropists donated paintings to the museum and the

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Academia%20de%20Pintura,%20Santiago%20de%20Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none"><i>Academia de Pintura</i></A> produced

				<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/country/Chile" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Chile</A>'s artistic tradition was there a mandate

				for art or attempt to create one. Only in the salons do we find interest

				expressed in making the display available to the poor and only here is fine art

				mixed with applied arts. The elite believed Chilean fine arts represented and

				were integral to national progress, yet the arts also served to distinguish

				the elite from the masses and further strengthen

				class and social divisions. Art served to cement national fault lines, rather

				than unite Chileans in the pursuit of beauty.</P>
