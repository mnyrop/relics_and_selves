This natural disposition might be attributed to blood inheritance, for my maternal surname, Thwaites, has been carried by more than one travelling naturalist. Two years later, new readings increased my addiction to Natural History and made me decide to form a 'museum'. The road to Palermo was thus submitted to collecting every Sunday, providing me with rich harvests of quartz and jaspers, while the street pavements supplied magnificent samples of other rocks. <i>(Moreno 1879: 9)</i>

However, it is only when, in 1870, due to the yellow fever epidemic, the family moves to its estancia in the south of the province, that the child naturalist&acute;s true initiation takes place: <blockquote>The journey was short, but rich in results.

It is, then, this singular coincidence of the individual&acute;s 'arrival' at adult age and the child collector&acute;s conversion into scientist, with the presumed 'arrival at maturity' of the state at large, thanks to the conquest of the southern plains site of this scientific initiation, that makes the career of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Moreno,%20Francisco%20Pascasio%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Francisco P.

Moreover, the way in which <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Moreno,%20Francisco%20Pascasio%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Moreno</A>, in his writings as well as in the setup of his museum, explicitly insists again and again on this coincidence as a sort of founding fable, poses the question of how this <i>Bildungsroman</i> of 'nature&acute;s' submission to 'knowledge' was converted into an exemplary and didactic fiction that had the purpose to mould the museum public into a model, illustrated citizenry stripped of barbarian and archaic supersticions and habits. This article will try to argue that, in a uniquely theatrical and performative aesthetic of display, the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20de%20La%20Plata" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">La Plata museum</A> would narrate the foundational violence of the positivist state as a triumphant arrival at scientific self-knowledge, and display its vast collections in such a way as to offer each visitor a miniaturised experience of the scientist&acute;s self-discovery revealed in the vast natural history of the nation. In the first part, I will briefly sketch the museum&acute;s foundation process from 1877 to 1906, the year <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Moreno,%20Francisco%20Pascasio%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Moreno</A> steps down as director in protest against the museum&acute;s annexation to the new National <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Universidad%20Nacional%20de%20La%20Plata" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">University of La Plata</A>.

For the term 'desert' had not so much referred to particular geographical features, but rather to a territory beyond the reach of the law, and inhabited by native as well as by 'dissident mestizo' populations who had been able to evade coercion by crossing a mobile and unstable border. <i>(Vi&ntilde;as 1983, Mart&iacute;nez Sarasola 1992)</i> The 'frontier question' which had dominated political debates in the 1870s, then, was about the establishment and consolidation of a liberal, capitalist hegemony over a cross-cultural subsistence economy and a socio-cultural order based, among many other things, on <i>compadrazgo</i>, violence and a code of honour specific to an equestrian society which had emerged in the post-independence void of a centralized state authority.</P>

                                <A NAME="N1209"></A>In the travel narratives of the second half of the 1870s, the natural sciences (including the emerging discipline of anthropology) began to assume priority over the legal discourse of submission of, or arrangements with, the Indians, thus anticipating the shift from law to medicine as a metalanguage of social intervention and observation that was to take place after 1880. (Ter&aacute;n 1987: 11-54) Naturalist travel thus narrates the operation of political, legal and military violence of which it constitutes the vanguard, as a quest for knowledge: the measuring of geographical space, and the collection and classification of its fauna and flora, its minerals and its 'ancient and modern' human inhabitants, is presented as the constatation of a natural order that mimics (or, in the language of the texts, prefigures and justifies) the equilibrium of the liberal state. Paradoxically, then, this order is at once a fact of nature, and one that has yet to be imposed on a 'perverted' space, a space of barbarism which until then has disobeyed the laws of evolution.</P>

                                <BR>It is not so much the almost too obvious contempt for the other&acute;s humanity which makes this passage such a telling one: rather it is, for one part, the fact that the museum is not only presupposed, in this and other scenes of violent erasure of future museum objects, as the necessary destination of the journey and its findings ("...our sanguinary instincts are neither appeased by watching the curious penguins defend [...] their young fledglings. Twenty of them end up in the womb of the boat, victims of collectionism..."), but also as the one which redeems and justifies, post factum, the naturalist&acute;s violence and its anticipated implication, that is, conquest, as an operation that safeguards what it has to erase so as to study the order of nature and impose that of the state. While in the act of mapping the territory the presence of this conquering and foundational violence is guaranteed by its inscription into physical space (and here an interesting line runs from <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Moreno,%20Francisco%20Pascasio" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Moreno</A>&acute;s use of national history as principal source of toponymy to <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Zeballos,%20Estanislao%20Severo" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Zeballos</A>&acute;s use of both fellow scientists&acute; and defeated indigenous chiefs&acute; names), in the experience of collecting not only the object, but also the violence of its erasure, is erased in the very moment of its inscription. For violence is only quoted, ironically, as something the naturalist does not actually indulge in: his massacres are not the genocidal massacres of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/military/Ej%e9rcito%20Federal%20Argentino" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">the federal army</A> but massacres of penguins; and if he does want the Indian&acute;s head, he wants it not quite in the way the Indian had feared he would. If the naturalist violates nature and commits 'sacrilegous' acts of ravage, these are immediately downplayed by flashing an ironical eye to the reader. Irony, then, becomes the dominant trope in <i>Viaje a la Patagonia Austral</i>, for it binds together the two principal strains of narrative: the national adventure of conquest and the scientific adventure of collecting, thus prefiguring the material narrative staged at the museum. Both adventures are told in the language of initiation, the first as a ritual passage from barbarism (and the disorder of the 'desert') to civilization (and the order of 'nature'), the second as one from adolescent amateur to adult scientist (and eventually to museum director). Irony is what makes it possible at one and the same time to allude to violence as foundational (the 'conquest of the desert' narrated as an epic), and to downplay it denying its epic character, as author and readers know that the language of romance and adventure is only 'quoted' but actually out of place where the adversary only consists of (defenseless) wild animals and of wild men and women. At the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20de%20La%20Plata" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">La Plata museum</A>, this irony would reveal its tragic face in the ghostly re-encounter of naturalists, Indians, and (stuffed) animals, former inhabitants of a space which now only existed as a simulation of itself in travel books and museums.</P>

The rooms holding the art collection and the library were placed on top of those containing the collections of indigenous anatomy and ethnography. Man&acute;s development, while certainly set within the greater frame of natural evolution, was at once less immediate and more complex, the leap from 'barbarism' to 'civilisation' being more than just the sum of gradual modifications.</P>

The impression the little instructed visitor begets from these objects, that is, those he may understand with his overall criteria, is then transmitted to his friends, who are inspired to see them, to comment on them, and from one comment to the next they are ripped of the first impressions and the false atavisms they may have carried at first, and thus a conscious interest for the museum is born. [...] I have noticed that many of the visitors to this establishment frequently return; there are some who come back every Sunday, spending hours in the rooms open to the public, which are not even the most interesting ones. For the uneducated public the <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museo%20de%20la%20Plata" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">museum</A> has become a pleasant place to meet; they respectfully observe the displays, enthuse over a hen with chicks, a wildcat which has caught a partridge, etc., and forget about the tavern which could lead them to crime.[...] Thus, gradually, that which the eyes learn, cultivates the spirit of the people, and this is one of the most beneficious tasks of this kind of establishment.<i>(Moreno 1891: 33-4)</i>

                                </blockquote>  As Tony Bennett has argued, the institutions of the 'exhibitionary complex' in late nineteenth century, in complementation of Foucault&acute;s 'carceral archipielago', intervened in the formation of disciplinary and power relations not through penalty and confinement, but through performativity and display. Along with exhibitions, fairs, zoological gardens and department stores, museums thus integrated "a set of cultural technologies concerned to organize a voluntarily self-regulating citizenry" <i>(Bennett 1995: 63)</i>. But while exhibitions and fairs retained from earlier forms of Foucault&acute;s 'juridico-discursive' exhibition of power, the dimension of the momentaneous and spectacular, museums, instead, were conceived as sites of permanent display of knowledge-power, "a power which was not reduced to periodic effects but which, to the contrary, manifested itself precisely in displaying its ability to command, order, and control objects and bodies, living or dead." <i>(Bennett 1995: 66)</i>
