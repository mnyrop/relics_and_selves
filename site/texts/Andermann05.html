For many years I had promised myself the satisfaction of visiting this museum. Thanks to the publications of its venerable director Dr. Hermann Burmeister over the last quarter of a century, its collections are better known in the United States than those of any other establishment of its kind in South America. His discoveries and descriptions of the great Megatherium, Mylodon, Glyptodon, and other fossils, have made us as familiar with these monsters from other eras as if they were modern animals. Unfortunately, the museum is open to visitors only on Sundays; however, I was granted the great privilege of unlimited access to all its showrooms whenever and for the length of time I desired. You can easily imagine the pleasure these visits made me experience. What would our North American palaeontologists not give for only an hour in the presence of these ancient fossils whose interest, which is great, is almost matched by their historical value, for they represent the eras of geological history? [...] They are displayed, in their majority, at the centre of two large showrooms, so as to facilitate their observation from all angles; here we find complete samples from different eras, of the Glyptodon, giant progenitor of the armadillos which are found in all the pampa, digging their caves into the very graves of their formidable ancestors; there are also two excellent specimens of Scelidotherium, another two of Mylodon, and a number of samples of Megatherium, these enormous tardigrades whose discovery has revealed to the learned men of Europe the existence in this part of the world, of extinct animals formerly unknown to science... It is sad, however, that such an important museum, for its intrinsic value as well as for its tradition, should have to store its treasures in small and poorly lit rooms with low ceilings, and accessible only across a large and tiresome wooden staircase and a narrow corridor; the locale destroys all the effect this unvaluable collection would produce if it were conveniently displayed and presented to the public in an adequate building...<i>(Ward 1889: 145-6)</i>

A. B. Beaumont</A>&acute;s <i>Journeys to Buenos Ayres, Entre-R&iacute;os and the Banda Oriental</i> (1826-28) tell us a more precarious and, perhaps, more significant story: <blockquote>Amongst the Republic&acute;s projects of improvement was a museum, and to this effect the President included a 'conservateur' on his list of prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. When this gentleman arrived at Buenos Aires, one of the first things he inquired was, of course, the whereabouts of the museum. He was informed that as yet no public building of such a name existed, but that a collection of natural history would soon be in his possession. For several days they made serious inquiries everywhere to come up with this treasure, but did not find any trace of it. Until one day a servant casually set foot on a wooden cage which had served as footstool to his predecessors, and which contained, to everyone&acute;s great surprise, the long-sought treasure. The collection consisted of a mixture of birds&acute; feathers and animal skins, all much damaged by ill treatment and insects. There were parrots with their heads missing, parrakets without their tails -other birds with neither heads nor tails- and the much deteriorated skins of some wild animals. All this, naturally, was dismissed as of little use, and the professor commissioned to form a new collection. Thus on the days of fine weather, the professor set out to hunt for birds, other animals and reptiles on the banks of the river and the islands, and, whenever he had the time, embalmed them. A room at the old Santo Domingo convent was chosen as deposit for these objects and furbished with rows of cages with a glass window on either side, as well as with a collection of physical instruments. When I left the city, the collection had slowly attained a more serious form. <i>(Beaumont in Gallardo 1976: 3-4; my translation)</i>

No more than eight individuals, and no more than seventy objects, apart from the trophies, are registered; and these constitute, so to speak, all the acquisitions made by the establishment during the large and awesome dominion of Rosas."<i>(Burmeister 1864: 3)</i> </blockquote> In passing, it is interesting to note that <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Burmeister,%20Karl%20Hermann" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Burmeister</A>, having resided in the country for only two years, quotes textually here from a report written in 1856 by <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Trelles,%20Manuel%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Manuel Trelles</A>, speaker of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/socialcultural/Asociaci%f3n%20de%20Amigos%20de%20la%20Historia%20Natural%20del%20Plata,%20Buenos%20Aires" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">the local natural history society</A>, who, where <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Burmeister,%20Karl%20Hermann" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Burmeister</A> speaks of the "larga y funesta dominaci&oacute;n de Rosas", had merely referred to a "larga dominaci&oacute;n". <i>(Trelles 1856: 71)</i> Whereas <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Trelles,%20Manuel%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Trelles</A> had registered a shift in collecting policies from natural history to a partisan, politicized history of the federalist state, then, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Burmeister,%20Karl%20Hermann" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Burmeister</A> -quite certainly aware of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Sarmiento,%20Domingo%20Faustino" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Sarmiento</A>&acute;s historical narrative of an epic clash between the forces of civilization and barbarism on the Argentine plains- rewrites it in terms of a barbarian intrusion and profanation of the crystalline order of natural history, just as the hoofs of the gauchos&acute; horses, in <i>Facundo</i> (1845), had insulted the paved streets of the civilized city.

The first of these, once again, is considered almost obsolete, as it only contains works sent home by the young Argentine painters holding government grants for their studies in Europe (some of these would eventually figure in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes when it was inaugurated in 1896). The historical collection contains some relics of Rivadavia and trophies from Independence ("legitimate trophies", in contrast to the ones introduced by Rosas) and, in the subsection "antiquities", now holds the Egyptian mummies (<A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Burmeister,%20Karl%20Hermann" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Burmeister</A> mentions three rather than one) along with the Peruvian pottery and a series of 22 paintings by Miguel Gonz&aacute;lez depicting the conquest of Mexico.</P>

This is the richest part of the Buenos Aires Museum, as the territory of this province is the most abundant in these objects known in the entire world. Therefore Buenos Aires is the most appropriate place to form the most precious collection known in this part of the world. The most curious and complete skeletons of antediluvian animals shown in the museums of London, Paris, Madrid, Turine, etc., have all come from the Province of Buenos Aires. Today, however, thanks to the wise measure of its Government prohibiting the exportation of fossil remains, the Museum of Buenos Aires will see its collection grow day by day. It is a patriotic duty for the sons of this country to preserve these treasures of its earth, and to deposit them in the Museum of their fatherland. <i>(Burmeister 1864: 7)</i> </blockquote> </P>

In reaction to Rosas&acute;s 'treacherous' donation of fossils to the main imperial powers of Europe, the new legislation underscored the nexus between the completeness and giant dimensions of the skeletons and the glory of the nation. At the same time as Argentina, by claiming for itself the fossil treasures unearthed from its plains, entered the group of 'civilized nations', an investigating subject rather than a mere object of science, this discourse also formulated a territorial ontology: Argentineans were the legitimate owners of these petrified bones because both humans and glyptodons emerged from the same, forever Argentinean, soil.<BR>
