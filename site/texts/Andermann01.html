The museum guide, then, must not be read as a mere transcription of a spatial arrangement but as one that inscribes into it a perspective, a way of seeing, and thus as an attempt to control the performative dimension of museum space as a crossroads of the production and reception of 'knowledge'. As Mieke Bal writes, <blockquote>"the space of the museum presupposes a walking tour, an order in which the exhibits and panels are to be viewed and read. Thus it addresses an implied 'focalizer', whose tour is the story of the production of the knowledge taken in and taken home."<i> (Bal 1992: 561)</i>

Pedro II can be observed; in the room of Brazilian archaeology, one sees a scepter made of compact slate, of one metre and seven centimetres length, and other curious Indian objects. In the archaeological salon: an idol, offered to the museum in 1843; two embalmed heads of chiefs from New Zealand, from whence they were brought by Jacques Arang&oacute; and sent to the museum by the minister Villa Nova Portugal; a cape of red and yellow feathers from the habit of Mamahamal&uacute;, king of the Sandwich isles, who gave it to D. Pedro I when visiting Rio de Janeiro [...]; a statue of Charity donated in 1845 by its author Fernando Petrich; the skull of an Asian elephant, offered by D. Pedro I; a narwhal's tooth of fourteen palms&acute; length; a great piece of a swordfish's spur, found drilled one palm and six fingers deep into the flank of the war brig Constancia, and donated to the museum on 29 March 1830; an indigenous canoe made of a single piece of jutahy bark, and many other indigenous objects. <i>(Azevedo 1877: 236-9)</i>

Rather than to classify the objects within the naturalist's grid of species and eras, this gaze attempts a kind of material philology which reconstructs every single object's discovery and its chain of previous owners, resulting in a kaleidoscope of minuscule narratives of adventure.

The beautiful collections of typical dresses and feather garments which the Museum already owned, were brought into a more artistic order; arms, arrows, marac&aacute;s, trumpets, blowpipes, bows, occupied a great extension of the room; the stone axes, grinders, tamping tools, tembet&aacute;s, etc., in their regular distribution formed tables worthy of comparison. [...] Exhibits of carbon paintings, of remains of birds and fish extracted from the sambaqui tombs, a topographical sketch of these exquisite formations of caves, human skulls and skeletons found in these, stone tools and arrowheads, composed another group which attracted visitors&acute; attention.

                                <BR> The combination of these didactic arrangements of material culture with simulations of indigenous villages and bodies celebrated `Indian life&acute; in the aesthetic of the ruin: the public display of indigenous men and women, surrounded by their tools and ritual objects, the remains of their dead and the plaster replicas of their own mortal frames, actually resembled an autopsy performed in an anatomical theatre. Even the living, this performance seemed to say, can be shown as if already dead, for death -or, in evolutionist terms, extinction- was their ultimate fate. At the same time, this refocusing of the museological gaze from archaeological remains onto the surface of the body anticipated a shift from the panoramic to the panoptic: the very way in which visitors of the Anthropological Exhibition were enabled (or at least made to believe) to catch a glimpse of the `back region&acute; of indigenous village life, without those looked at being able to return their gazes (as they had been enframed as museum exhibits), would soon become the gaze of physiology assessing the entire population&acute;s genetic qualities and their subsequent ability to integrate the nation. <A HREF="http://maple.cc.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Lacerda,%20Jo%e3o%20Baptista%20de%20" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Lacerda</A>, appointed director in 1895 after the move of <A HREF="http://maple.cc.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?institution/academic/Museu%20Nacional,%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">the institution</A> to the Quinta de Boa Vista, the former palace of <A HREF="http://maple.cc.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/politician/Pedro%20II" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">the Emperor</A>, was also the chief ideologue of <i>branqueamento</i> and, as official Brazilian delegate to the first International Raciological Conference in <A HREF="http://maple.cc.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/city/Geneva" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Geneva</A> in 1911, expressed the view that in a century Brazil would have achieved complete `whitening&acute; of its population. <i>(Schwarcz 1993: 11)</i> From the former seat of monarchy, then, the physiological sciences turned the museum gaze outward and transformed `the people&acute; into the object of a new museology; one, however, which rather than to arrange groups and species in the horizontal and normative order of the Linnaean panorama, sought to predict (and establish the laws guiding) its possible alterations -degenerations, abnormities, mutations-.

Cross-breeding between Indian and white is sparse among us compared to that of white and black. We can easily understand that this is how it must be, because it was these two races which lived in intimate and continuous contact with one another in the populated centres; whereas the indigenous tribes remained far from the civilized areas occupied by the white race. As workforce, the Indian is unquestionably inferior to the black; he is more agile than the latter but his physical resistance and muscular strength are sensibly lower. We have measured with a dynamometre the muscular strength of adult individuals belonging to the Boror&oacute;, Botocudo, and Cherente tribes, and the instrument showed a force below that which is habitually observed in white and black individuals.<i> (Lacerda 1906: 100-1)</i>
