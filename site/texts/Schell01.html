	<blockquote>Fishing is, among pastimes, the one which we should exercise more.  It is the one that allows the most benefit for the body and for our intellectual facilities, so that it is of positive and safe utility with little expense.  It benefits the first, strengthening [the body] with the various exercises that one is obliged to do and with [the] air [that is] breathed full of oxygen and impregnated with those marine emanations so healthy to all the organs of respiration that they gain new vigor.  Naturally beaches constantly bathed by the tides are addressed.  

	...There is no occupation or entertainment, to our belief, that requires more lively imagination, more activity in all the senses at the same time, united by a tranquility of spirit... it is for this that there are moments during which the emotion almost drowns [one].  In this struggle one learns to have control over one's self.  During particular fishing sessions, [one has] to capture with one glance a multiple and varied action. It is true that in this school can be formed great characters.  

	Of course there is also sedentary fishing.</blockquote>



(Obviously sedentary fishermen were an inferior variety.)  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Delf%edn,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Delf&iacute;n</A>, a doctor in the navy, saw fishing as a way men (?) could conquer and control the emotions which threatened to overwhelm them when confronted with nature's glories.  <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/scientist/Delf%edn,%20Federico" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Delf&iacute;n</A>'s description of fishing suggests an attractive afternoon's occupation.  His medical training probably accounts for his concern with the health benefits of fishing.  Very few articles I have found link the emotional aspects of nature with the scientific ones as done here.</P>

Although most fish were already 'known' to the scientific world, many of the most common fish were not yet displayed.  Even fish easily found in the local markets for the dinner dinnertabletable were not found in galleries.  In circumstances where museums already possessed a sample of a particular fish, duplicates were always useful, both for exchanging with other museums and for replacing displays that had become moth-eaten. <i>(Delf&iacute;n 1900: 148)</i>  <BR>

For instance, in May 1900, 720 people visited the museum during the month.  Numbers were inconsistent, being as high as 1035 in June and just 16 in March.  Each month a handful of foreigners visited the museum (between 10 and 35), while a smaller number of people visited the library (between 3 and 23).
