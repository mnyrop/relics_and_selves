However, to say that the literary language which articulates and accompanies the slow but firm military advance towards the South rushing into its final stage by the early 1870s, is one of violence, is not the entire truth: it is a language capable of compassion and even tenderness. "To treat them with sweetness and justice was indispensable in order to erase the bloody memories of past horrors," says of the Indians the colonel <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/military/Barros,%20Alvaro" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Alvaro Barros</A>, later to become the first governor of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?place/region/Patagonia" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Patagonia</A>, in his <i>Fronteras y territorios federales de las Pampas del Sur</i>(1872) . Two pages further on he continues:



<blockquote>The resistance by the Indians who have sought refuge in the desert still unknown to us: hence the difficulties that will have to be overcome. As a first step of the plan, we have to choose between two options: 1&deg; to encircle the Indians in the desert, cutting all their communications to the other side of the R&iacute;o Negro. 2&deg; to enter and persecute them in the desert without mercy or contempt until exterminating them, to submit them, or to force them to seek refuge south of the R&iacute;o Negro, and thus to establish the frontier there.<i>(Barros 1872: 81-82)</i>

In other words, the literature of the Argentine frontier is violent not only, and not even in the first place, because it anticipates, promotes and narrates the erasure of the Indians, but because, moreover, it ratifies, celebrates and finally denies this very 'solution' by what we can call the erasure of violence.

<blockquote>The final memory that remains with me from that day is one of the execution of 2 Indians who had been taken prisoners. I can still see them, short and squat, impassible, in the clumsy attitude of the Indian on foot, standing in front of the General Command and replying invariably: 'I don&acute;t know' to all the questions the interpreter asked them about their chiefs, their forces and details of the invasion. Enough! the commander said simply. [...] The two men, their hands bound on their backs, ran, stumbled, and screamed at every blow: Se&ntilde;or! Se&ntilde;or! It was all the Spanish they knew. One of them, on spotting in front of him a pit without a parapet, plunged himself into it with his head first and disappeared. His agony was short at least, but the spectacle nonetheless repulsive; while his deprived executioners registered the water with their spears, multitudes of scared frogs assembled in dirty garlands on the walls of this open pit. I turned in horror and my gaze fell on the other Indian lying on the ground in agony. An official had mercy with him at last and had his throat cut, but as this was not enough, and as the horror of his death rattles became worse every instant, they drove a dagger into his heart.<i>(&Eacute;b&eacute;lot 1875-79: 74-75)</i>

<blockquote>The frontline soldier enters our army by two means: either he is hooked or condemned to the service of arms. In one case or the other, he sees his term expire without the Government or his immediate superior caring to release him. [...] The stocks and the stake, the colombiano and flogging with clubs have raised the cry of vengeance in his hidalgo heart, awaiting the day of battle to satisfy his revenge. But the day of battle comes, the blue and white flag rises above the smoke of combat, and the soldier forgets his anger and his vengeance. [...] The soldier has once again replaced the man: the fatherland&acute;s voice speaks to his heart in higher tones than any other feeling.<i>(Guti&eacute;rrez 1896: 281-282)</i>

Argentine anthropology is born here as a pillaging science, a secularizing experiment confirming the absolute power over life and death the new positivist elite has just attributed itself (and thus, the killings and dissections of Indian 'specimens' are not the contrary but a complement to the contemporary secularizing legislation on laicist education and civil marriage: both are disciplinary and discursive practices of the same progressive and authoritarian State, applying its archival machinery on the bodies and corpses of the population and the populace). While digging up Indian cemeteries, <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Zeballos,%20Estanislao%20Severo" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Zeballos</A> not only maintains, in the face of his scandalized and appalled indigenous and mestizo servants, the impassive and humorous spirit of the amateur scientist; he also stages this contrast in his text as a means of emphasizing his own distinctive position as a modernizing hero among supersticious, yet now powerless savages:



<blockquote>The indio Carriqueo was somewhat of a sight. He watched me from afar with eyes of an Asian tigress protecting her wounded kin. He spoke swiftly in his language, almost crying, moved about pointing his finger at me, and seemed desperate not to be able to pull his spear and add mine to the bodies of his brothers; and suddenly lowering the tone of his lectures, he supplicated me, his voice drowning under constant sobbings. Every bit I understood, yet I feigned understanding nothing.<i>(Zeballos 1881: 243)</i>

                                </blockquote> 

In the final chiasm, a whole attitude of self-security of the positivist state and its&acute; servants and propagators is summarized: the entire knowledge-power is on their side, while the Other ignores even their understanding him.  <BR>

After Pampa falls asleep at the end of the novel&acute;s first chapter, the <i>Bildungsroman</i>  of Quilito, the male heir to the impoverished  patrician household where she serves, unfolds to the continuous, and disturbing, presence of the Indian maid, always at work or receiving punishment on the very margins of the narrative scene. When, finally, she speaks up for the second time, towards the end of the novel, her gloomy figure almost incarnates the guilt which shortly thereafter will precipitate her young master into suicide:



<blockquote>He took her arm and pushed her towards the door; she resisted herself looking at the young man from her strange eyes: '<i>Ni&ntilde;o</i> not love Pampa, she said slowly, with that strange pronounciation of hers, Pampa very sad ... last night dream that mother have died! Cristiano kill with very large knife ... I wanted die, too!' Poor girl! With her hand, horribly disfigured by chilblains, she rubbed her eyes making the pitiful sound of the child that is about to cry; Quilito felt sorry and caressed her filthy hair, always resistant to the discipline of the comb: 'Don&acute;t cry, stupid, what you have dreamt is a big lie; all dreams are lies, listen to what I tell you. Your mother is healthy and well, and one day she will come to see you. <i>(Ocantos 1891: 119-20)</i>

                                <A NAME="N1106"></A>This scene is actually a chiasm, too, for only a few pages further on Quilito will have died after having entrusted his old, indefensive father and aunt to the Indian orphan servant. The slave girl who dreams with violent and insisting images of massacres and deportations, is finally to prevail over the promising young oligarch, to the extent of taking his place in seeing after the elderly parents. It is obvious that this ending with its implications of historical inversion would have been impossible to construct with that other survivor of the frontier,the gaucho, and not just because this latter lacked the skills for such domestic tasks as nurturing the elderly and sick. Rather, I would like to suggest that while, in the literature following the historical landmark of 1880, the invocations of the gaucho and his traditional rural world reoccur almost ritually in order to demonstrate (or to recall) the vitality of a creole and patriarchal order, here this very order has become an orphan of the future, on the brink of a solitary death in the company of a 'monstruous' Indian slave who is herself a personification of guilt rather than comfort. It is important, however, to mention the political dimension of <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Ocantos,%20Carlos%20Mar%eda" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Ocantos</A>&acute;s novel as part of a number of works written around 1890 and addressing in various ways the financial crash that took place in that very year: the figure of the Indian, in this context, becomes useful to the effect of denouncing the 'excesses' of market speculation, but at the same time of pointing to the dysfunctionalities of a modernizing process where there continued to be 'archaic relics' of a 'prehistoric' past. This is why <A HREF="http://curlew.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/rands/q_texts.pl?person/letrado/Ocantos,%20Carlos%20Mar%eda" TARGET="blank" STYLE="color:#663300; text-decoration:none">Ocantos</A>&acute;s text does not even remotely consider nostalgic retreat into a countryside previous to the ruptures and contradictions of modernity, an imaginary solution that was already being proclaimed by some early forerunners of turn-of-the-century criollismo: the invocation of the Indians does not lead towards identity but towards difference. In what will soon become a pattern of Argentine literature and culture, it is an accusation of the imperfect and incomplete character of modernity on the periphery rather than a vindication of the desert. To evoke the gaucho is to regret his 'disappearance' and recompose an imaginary, collective creole past; to evoke the Indian is to regret her survival, in spite of all the 'desert campaigns', at the heart of a nation that can never be modern and never be one.</P>
