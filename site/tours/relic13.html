Rather than a display of the enduring wealth and diversity of indigenous culture in Brazil, however, the exhibition openly presented itself as a giant operation of salvage of an anthropological patrimony doomed to become extinct in only a couple of years' time. Just as Moreno and Ambrosetti at the museums of La Plata and Buenos Aires, Netto was firmly convinced that <i>all</i> the objects assembled at his exhibition were, strictly speaking, archaeological ones, even where he had taken them from indigenous communities he had visited only a few months before its opening. The exhibition, then, displayed indigenous life in an aesthetic of the ruin, of something already belonging to the past, something superseded by the course of time. The most striking image of this 'mortification of alterity' were the plaster casts of native men and women, who had been brought to Rio de Janeiro for the occasion from Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais, and whose replicas were dressed up in native costumes to stage indigenous 'village scenes': last glimpses on an 'everyday life' perhaps already lost forever.
