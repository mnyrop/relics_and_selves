Twenty years earlier, Meireles had completed what would remain one of his most influential works, and a cornerstone of a kind of historical painting heavily influenced by French academicism yet also often based on a thorough command of historical and ethnographic writing on Brazil. The painting, 'The first mass in Brazil', was first exhibited in Paris, where the artist had studied on a government grant; the result of several years of work and the reading, among others, of Ferdinand Denis큦 history of Brazilian literature and Pedro Vaz de Caminha큦 letters from the early days of colonisation. In 1876, the picture was acquired by the Brazilian government and displayed in the Empire큦 pavilion at the Philadelphia world큦 fair (alongside, significantly, two equally monumental works dedicated to the commemoration of the Paraguayan war).
