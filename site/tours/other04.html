However, anthropological exhibitions and museums also indulged in a
mode of showing 'otherness' in a more spectacular mode of illusionism.
'Life groups' of plaster figures such as the one seen above -an image
taken, like the previous one, at the 1882 Brazilian Anthropological
Exhibition at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro- allowed viewers a
glimpse at an 'indigenous everyday life' that never threatened to
return the gaze, as in a panopticon or a peep-show. Thus, the subject
of the gaze could experience a sensation of superiority and safety over
the bodies put entirely her/his disposal. At the same time, their
motionless poses (as if caught in a three-dimensional photograph) also
suggested their being caught in an unchangeable, self-same, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">dead</span> time, in stark contrast to the
dynamic, progressive time of the viewing subject. <br>
      <br>
Very often, the power relations implicit in the 'life group' displays
closely reflected those involved in their own making, as in the image
shown above: the plaster casts for the figures on display had in fact
been taken from real Brazilian aborigines who had been brought to Rio
de Janeiro for this very purpose (whether or not this was with their
own consent is never mentioned in the exhibition's records). They can
thus be read as realist representations, but not of the 'village life'
they pretend to depict but of the colonial relations of power and
violence that are their condition of possibility. Almost all the images
in this tour can be read in much the same way.<br>
