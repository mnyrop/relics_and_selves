Representations of slavery in the nineteenth century are more common
among European traveling artists, often depicting the harshness of
living conditions and punishments endured by slaves, than among
Brazilians. In fact, much of Brazilian art during the Imperial era
studiously avoided the issue in favour of historical or literary
subject matter related to the earlier colonial period and to fantasies
about chivalric indigenous warriors and seductive vixens of the forest.
Where the issue appeared at all in official art, in was often in a
highly allegorical fashion, and in praise of the Imperial regime's
policy of moderate, gradual advances towards liberation, as in the
above statue made in homage to the law of 1871 that granted free status
to all children born from enslaved parents (though not to the latter).<br>
