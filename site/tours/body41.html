The claims made on the indigenous body past and present by the new scientific disciplines, then (many of which were also implicated in the development of techniques of surveillance of the popular, mass body), were not necessarily univocal, and certainly did not mean that Indians were no longer used in the iconography of nation and state. In fact, Carlos André Gomes´s design for the Brazilian pavilion at the Universal Exhibition of 1889, for example, almost exactly replicated the allegorical use of romanticized natives to mark out a mythical territory, an Empire enclosed by giant rivers, that Rochet had already employed on his 1865 statue of D. Pedro I.
