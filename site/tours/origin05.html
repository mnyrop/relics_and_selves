Augusto Ballerini's painting of San Martín in the Andes, produced on commission from the National Historical Museum, synthecizes the ideological implications of this narrative of the founding hero. San Martín, depicted in a pose and position typical of the genre of historical allegory, is observing the anonymous mass of soldiers on their way up a narrow canyon between steep mountains from the vantage point of a high cliff, surrounded by a small group of officers yet also set apart, such that his solitary figure is at the centre of everything: the landscape, the ondulating serpentine of the marching army (whose imaginary end is precisely the small group of horsemen immediately behind him). It is an image of authority and abnegation, and at the same time a tale of national initiation: in following the solitary genius, the great leader, who communicates with them (literally speaking, in terms of the painting's pictorial organisation) through a superior caste of officers, the male collective 'masters' the obstacle of the landscape and thus <i>makes it their own</i>. The crossing of the Andes is a crucial moment in the narrative of national origins: a liminal experience, in which the limits of national space are fixed and endowed with sacred meaning, as the moment in which the right to this space is wrested from its previous colonial master.
