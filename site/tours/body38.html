As in Brazil and in Chile –where a mythicized Araucanian resistance against the Spaniards remained a key part of nationalist rhetoric despite the genocidal war waged against their descendants in the final decades of the nineteenth century– the symbolic appropriation of an indigenous prehistory in Argentina did not stop scientists to treat living natives as lesser human beings. Francisco P. Moreno, the director and founder of the Museum of La Plata, following the invasion of the southern Pampas and Patagonia by the federal army, 'rescued' some of the indigenous chiefs and their families from prison camps near Buenos Aires, to have them serve as wardens, carpenters and, simultaneously, exhibits at the museum. Many of them died after only a few years, whereupon museum staff would take facial plaster casts of them and then expose the skeleton and preserve particular organs such as the brain for comparative physiological analysis.
