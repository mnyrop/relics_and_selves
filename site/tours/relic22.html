Even before the definitive abolition of slavery, Brazilian photographers would offer collections of 'types of slaves' such as Christiano Júnior's series of <i>carioca</i> street scenes from the 1860s and 1870s. Often the actors posing for Christiano's <i>cartes-de-visites</i> were indeed former slaves, who for a couple of coins were staging a harmonious image of the past for the photographer's lens. Yet Christiano's images, while intended as industrially manufactured relics of the mid-century, could also be read (literally) against the grain: as testimonies of the galloping pauperisation of the urban black population of Rio de Janeiro shortly before and, indeed, <i>after</i> abolition, under the pressure of large-scale 'urban reforms' coupled with real estate speculation that resulted in the demolition of popular quarters such as the Morro do Castelo and the formation of the first <i>favelas</i>, or hillside shantytowns.
