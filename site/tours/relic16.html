The Brazilian Museum not only held an ample sample of native human remains; it also possessed a small collection of Egyptian mummies the Emperor Pedro I had purchased in the 1830s from an Italian arts dealer (who had, in fact, been shipping them to Buenos Aires, from whose Museo Público he had received an earlier offer). The possession of Egyptian antiquities sustained the Museum's claim to collect and represent the world beyond the borders of Brazil –hence, by the time, it still called itself the 'Imperial' rather than 'National' Museum–, attempting to compete on an equal level with its 'imperial' rivals of London, Paris, Berlin, and elsewhere, likewise busy in wresting the spoils of their colonies' antiquities from one another. Possession of the relics of the Occident's classical past –and those of others–, in the nineteenth century became one of the most powerful expressions of imperial potency.
