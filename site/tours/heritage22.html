In an entirely different vein, but equally unimpressed by the historical record, Brazilian arts and letters had fashioned, over much of the nineteenth century, a romanticised image of erotic encounters with Indian maidens in remote forests of the colonial past, a national founding myth that bypassed the problem of black slavery and the increasing international isolation into which it was bringing the Brazilian Empire. Meireles's painting was inspired by the indianist poem 'Caramuru' by Santa Rita Durão, a tragic story on unresponded love of an indian girl for a Portuguese adventurer. The work was first exhibited at the 1866 Fine Arts Exhibition, where Meireles was being accused by critics of having plagiarised Eugene Isabey's genre scene 'Virginia morte sur la plage' while on a stipend in Paris, and that the local theme and scenery were only a thin cover-up.
