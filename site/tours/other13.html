Lacerda's speech was eventually published with a cover illustrated by
Spanish-born Brazilian painter Modesto Brocos y Gomez's painting <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Redemption of Cam</span>, which
illustrated its main hypothesis, as expressed in the subtitle: "The
negro turning white, in the third generation, as an effect of racial
mixture". According to this theory, the "superior" qualities of "white
blood" would eventually prevail over the "inferior" components, whilst
at the same time absorbing their contributions: the agility of "the
Indian", and the strength and endurance of "the African". Thus, in a
rather peculiar twist on&nbsp; Darwinism's hypothesis of natural
selection and the survival of the fittest, Brazilian anthropologists
could presage a bountiful future for their nation precisely <span
 style="font-style: italic;">because</span> of its "racial" diversity
since, whereas the "inferior" parts of the national body were bound to
become extinct, they nonetheless had something to contribute to a
people that would end up being "more perfect" than its European
ancestors.<br>
      <br>
In fact, Brocos y Gomez's painting nonetheless also contains a darker,
more complex message, despite its declamatory visual rhetoric. In the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">piet&agrave;</span>-like central figure of
the child whose gaze follows the mother's finger, pointing towards the
dark-skinned grandmother who is looking upward, as if thanking the
heavens for the gift of the (white) infant, what is also pointed at is
the legacy of slavery and its oblivion soon after it was officially
abolished in 1888. Meanwhile, the clearly established hierarchy of
gender (the white child is fathered by a Portuguese man with a mulatto
woman) also reveals, even as it explicitly denies it, the social and
sexual violence beneath the concept of "miscigenation".<br>
