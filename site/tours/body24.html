Slavery, which was only abolished in Brazil in 1888, already became an object of nostalgia while it was still officially in place: 'Cartes de visite' picturing Afrobrazilian 'types' such as this one by Christiano Júnior from the 1870s, were used as invitations for social occasions, or taken abroad by wealthy Brazilians travelling to Europe, as a picturesque souvenir of a harmonious past peopled by submissive servants (models were paid by the photographer and would often impersonate several trades and occupations).
