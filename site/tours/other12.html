Whereas archaeologists concerned themselves with recovering the
material traits of pre-Conquest cultures, anthropology as practiced in
the late nineteenth century was primarily focused on the physiological
study of native bodies, living and dead. Disciplines such as
craneometry and osteology (the measuring and classification of skulls
and selected parts of the human skeleton) catered to a rising interest
in the evolution of the human species from its earliest ancestors.
South American anthropologists such as Francisco P. Moreno in Argentina
and Joao Baptista de Lacerda in Brazil were influential contributors to
debates in the field on whether humanity had descended from one or
several biological roots. Whilst few if any contenders questioned the
innate superiority of Europeans and their descendants over all other
"races", there was nonetheless a tension between those who searched for
a bygone "Golden Age" of Native American civilization in the tropics
(such as Ladislau Netto, the director of Rio de Janeiro's National
Museum and chief organizer of its Anthropological Exhibition) and those
who, like his successor Lacerda, ranked Brazil's "prehistoric"
inhabitants and their present-day descendants as an inferior species.
Lacerda, incidentally, represented Brazil at the 1911<br>
International Conference on Race in London, where he forespelled the
comprehensive "whitening" of the Brazilian population by the
mid-twentieth century.<br>
