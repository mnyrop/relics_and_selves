Meanwhile, in the large and increasingly massified coastal cities, the
growth of popular masses at the same time as social mobility remained
stymied by oligarchic rule, increased a fear of the "dangerous
classes". Disciplines such as sociology, social psychology and
criminology, which had emerged shortly before in France, Italy, and
Germany, rapidly spread among Latin American intelligentsias, as
providing a language that permitted to articulate the rising sense of
social unrest at the same time as containing it within a medicalizing
perspective that made it possible to all but omit the social causes of
the problem. Ironically, it were often the immigrant populations
recently arrived from Europe in order to populate and "civilize" the
emergent nation-states of Latin America who now became the focus of a
racist and pathologizing gaze.<br>
