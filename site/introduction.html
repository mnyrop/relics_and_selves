    <h1>Relics and Selves: an introduction</h1>

    

    <p align="right"> Jens Andermann<br />

                    Birkbeck College, University of London</p>

    

    <p> The decade from 1880 to 1890, as witness to attempts at

    political and social consolidation and their falling apart, is a

    cornerstone in the history of state-formation in Latin America. In

    the case of Argentina, it began with the Campaign of the Desert

    and ended with the (ephemeral) revolution of 1890; in Brazil the

    decade stretched from the first clashes between military and

    imperial authorities to the abolition of slavery and the overthrow

    of the Second Empire; in Chile, triumph in the War of the Pacific

    inaugurated a period terminating in constitutional crisis and

    civil warfare. The 1880s could thus be seen as the starting point

    of a pattern which would hold during most of the twentieth

    century, one in which apparently solid pacts and arrangements

    increasingly demonstrated their fragility and ultimate inability

    to contend with the conflicts brought about by entering the modern

    world order.  Fundamental to these conflicts was the contradictory

    treatment of "others" -be they immigrants, indigenous populations,

    former slaves or urban workers- in the space of the nation.</p>

    

    <p> It is within this period, too, that a whole range of new sites

    of formalisation and display of the nation's history, geography,

    nature, and art are created or reformed: museums of natural

    history and fine arts, geographical and historical societies,

    public monuments, national and international fairs all

    represented, reproduced, and displayed idealized images of the

    nation through symbolic means, thus providing a façade of unity

    and cohesion that obscured the profound divisions underlying

    it. Creating new symbolic environments where the nation could be

    experienced, these stages and institutions of culture were

    entrusted not only with guarding national patrimony and territory

    but, in a very real sense, with discovering one - ``discovering'',

    because iconicity was supposed to be always already inherent in

    objects, spaces and narratives, and ``constructing'', because both

    history and geography had to be ordered and labeled by the

    classifying gaze of science. As agents of State power, then, these

    environments proposed new definitions on what and who composed the

    nation. As such, they were sites of contested power and

    represented an imposition of a national project amid the turmoil

    of a transitional decade.</p>

    

    <p> This exhibition proposes to document and analyse the emergence

    and canonization of consecrating images of the nation-self by the

    end of the nineteenth century, comparing three Latin American

    countries which pass through different moments of transition

    towards formally republican state orders, but which in fact

    maintained a relatively exclusive concentration of power in the

    hands of small elites. Amongst their South American peers,

    Argentina, Brazil and Chile were the countries, which experienced

    the highest degrees of commercial and geopolitical interpellation

    and cooptation on the part of the imperialist powers (Britain in

    the first place, but also France and, to an increasing degree, the

    United States). At the same time, these interpellations

    contributed in imposing and accelerating, in all three countries,

    internal processes such as territorial integration and the

    centralisation of hegemonic functions by the State. As a result of

    these processes, national elites emerged, which shared the

    liberal, positivist and conservative ideas of their peers in the

    imperial centres.  Eventually, they would launch their own

    imperialistic agendas, which, on a regional or continental scale,

    sought a position of predominance for their own countries. The

    exhibition covers, therefore, not only the genres, disciplines and

    institutions which are put in charge of constructing iconic images

    of the State and of the nation-self, so as to produce a

    "desirable" citizenry in response, but it also envisages the

    participations of Argentina, Brazil and Chile at the world's fairs

    of the turn of the century, comparing these self-representations

    fashioned for a metropolitan audience with those forged at the

    national and continental exhibitions which, over the same period,

    take place in the countries themselves.</p>

    

    <p> The common approach bridging the analysis of materials as

    disperse in character as paintings and photographs, critical or

    literary texts, historical monuments, natural history or industry

    exhibitions, or maps and travel accounts, is provided here by an

    iconographic perspective on these representations of the self

    forged, in their great majority, by members of the ruling

    elite. These could be conceived, to a certain extent, as

    fetishistic images of community, bestowed with the task of

    securing channels of communication with the masses effectively

    excluded from any formal political participation, and thus of

    reproducing the existing hegemony by means of providing realms of

    imaginary performativity. However, the exhibition will also shed

    light on the "idolatric inclinations" at the very heart of the

    lettered city itself, which lets itself be seduced by the images

    and rituals of science and progress, by the eclectic façades of a

    europeanising architecture, or the theatrical displays of wealth

    and future glory which take place at the great industrial and

    agricultural fairs of the time.</p>

    

    <p> Given the enormous range of materials it was necessary to

    consider in this respect, the decade of the 1880s was chosen as a

    periodizing frame -albeit a loose one-, as it is then, too, that

    we can see substantial political repercussions of the

    transformations related to the technological revolution, which

    brought about a rise and diversification of production and

    consumption, and thus dramatically modified traditional relations

    between the rural and the urban, or between capital and region

    (transformations which sometimes culminated in secessionist

    insurrections or in civil war, as in the cases of Brazil and Chile

    at the start of the 1890s). But the 1880s also present themselves

    as a decade of profound changes in social and cultural values,

    related, among many other factors, to the massive inflow of

    European immigrants, the violent "pacification" of indigenous and

    mestizo populations in the rural hinterlands, or to the

    redefinition of race relations, as in the case of Brazil after the

    gradual abolition of slavery (in a legal process of almost twenty

    years, from 1871 to 1888).  In the strange mixture of motives for

    this latter move, between philantrophism and a new, scientific

    racism expressed, for instance, in projects of "repatriation" of

    blacks or in the eugenic agenda of "branqueamento" (that is, of

    gradual "whitening" of the Brazilian population), a particular

    style of Latin American fin-de siècle elite culture becomes

    exceptionally visible, one in which the ideas, messages and

    objects of modernity are being re-accommodated and put to new

    uses, in ways that are singularly ritualistic and fetishistic in

    character.</p>

    

    <p> It is only now, too, that institutions patronized directly by

    the State effectively become the principal agents to ensure the

    permanence of determinate structures of power and cohesion -in

    other words, the active production and reproduction of hegemony-

    by designing symbolic environments endowed with the power of the

    iconic. Their principal function, then, can be said to lie in the

    creation, or evocation, of a sense of belonging among their

    audience. What, however, constitutes a "symbolic environment"? A

    telling example may be found in a letter -undated, but almost

    certainly written at the beginning of the 1880s- the architect and

    engineer Enrique Dalmonte sent to the Uruguayan collector and

    historian Andrés Lamas, who at the time was serving as

    vice-president to the organising committee for the Buenos Aires

    World's Fair (an event which would eventually be downsized to a

    "continental exhibition", and which took place in 1882 on what is

    now the city's Plaza Once). Consulted over a compelling corporate

    design for the exhibition, Dalmonte came up with the following

    draft:</p>

    

    <blockquote>

    <em>The Park: Whatever the geometrical form of the terrain

    allocated to the park, it will not present any obstacle whatsoever

    to accommodate in it the geometrical form of the Argentine

    Republic. The external shape or remaining ground will be covered

    with little woods or shrubs, so as to underscore its

    demarcation. The geographical shapes of each and every of the

    fourteen provinces will be adopted for orchards and little woods:

    the animal kingdom will have its representation in cages, huts,

    caves, and areas fenced with electric wire. The mineral kingdom

    will form capricious streams and caves, with regard to the amount

    of elements that can be obtained from the provinces. [...] How

    many new enterprises may perhaps be born, how many associations

    may shoot up at the magical sight of the Exhibition of Buenos

    Aires: and finally, it is important that nationals as well as

    foreigners should find in the combination of the park an evident

    panorama, I would almost say, that they undertake an excursion,

    although on a small scale, across the entire Argentine

    Republic.</em>

    </blockquote>

    

    <p> In this multimediatic allegory of Argentina, different genres

    of spatial imagery (the map and the landscape) have been

    juxtaposed and brought into dialogue with various types of

    collections and display formats: a zoological and botanical

    garden, an industrial and agricultural fair, apart from which the

    show was also to include a historical exhibition and a fine arts

    salon. Even though the Buenos Aires fair would finally have to

    content itself with the far more modest dimensions of a single,

    temporary exhibition palace, Dalmonte´s project was far from

    expressing an individual, eccentric fantasy. Two years after the

    Continental Exhibition, construction work began on the nearby La

    Plata Museum, under the supervision of its director Francisco

    P. Moreno. Although the cartographical metaphor of the silhouette

    of the republic was omitted, the museum was indeed to be located

    in the midst of a vast park landscape containing a botanical and

    zoological garden displaying species from all parts of

    Argentina. The building itself would be in rectangular shape, with

    a semicircular gallery at each extreme, a design that was adopted

    so as to allow visitors to advance, in a continuous, uninterrupted

    stroll, through the subsequent stages of evolution. From the

    section of minerals and fossils, they would pass on to gaze at

    mounted skeletons of prehistorical animals and at the embalmed

    corpses of contemporary ones, upon which they would find

    themselves vis-à-vis remains of "ancient and modern Indians" -the

    latter being, in fact, the bodies of indigenous victims of the

    military campaigns which had only recently resulted in the

    conquest of vast regions of Patagonia and the southern

    Pampas. Also in the museum, albeit still alive, were the families

    of several Indian chiefs, which had been taken prisoners during

    the campaign, and who whilst at the museum were made to produce

    textiles and other artisan crafts to be displayed in the

    ethnographical section, following which the visitor's path would

    end in the section of fine arts. The arts, then, represented the

    highest stage in the long chain of evolution, a continuous order

    of succession, which amalgamated the new biological paradigms, and

    correspondent ideological notions of racial superiority and

    artistic taste. The Museum thus unfolded before its visitors a

    theatrical narrative ranging from remote prehistories to the very

    present, and whose subsequent stages were bound together not so

    much by textual explanations (which were, in fact, almost

    altogether absent from the original exhibition) but by a complex

    design featuring pseudo-indigenous ornamentation as well as

    paintings and murals of sceneries and themes alluded to by the

    exhibits.</p>

    

    <p> Certainly among the most "advanced" exhibitions in the

    Americas at the time, the La Plata Museum sent its visitors on a

    journey across space and time, an <em>"excursion, although on a

    small scale"</em> through the geography, natural history, and

    anthropology of their fatherland, in order to make them experience

    the nation as an organic totality. It is this very notion of

    totality, several of the critical pieces included in this virtual

    exhibition argue, alongside an almost unlimited faith in the

    mimetic powers of miniature and of allegory, which becomes one of

    the common denominators of symbolic environments at the end of the

    nineteenth century.  Perhaps we could, furthermore, distinguish

    two main lines, or currents, in the analysis of these imageries

    and stagings of the nation: on the one hand, the formalisations of

    national space as a geographical territory, on the part of

    national atlases and maps, and as a landscape of identity depicted

    and idealized in landscape painting and poetry, or in travel

    accounts. On the other hand, there are the domestications of the

    object world, as material or spiritual possessions of the national

    collective, on the part of the museums of history, anthropology

    and the natural sciences. On both levels -<em>territory</em> and

    <em>patrimony</em>- we can thus observe a certain tension between,

    on the one hand, a detached, scientific perspective towards an

    objectified material world, and a gaze which returns to the

    objects and spaces the halo of the auratic, thus converting them

    into residual fetishes of identity.  This tension is particularly

    visible in those genres of representation and display which by

    definition mediate between spatial and temporal conceptions of the

    national, that is, in the interrogations of "the other" (embodied

    in the indigenous or the popular), both from the point of view of

    anthropology (dominated, at the time, almost entirely by

    physiological currents) and that of ethnology and folklorism,

    approaches that begin to emerge, albeit still in contradictory and

    timid fashion, in the works of writers such as Juan B. Ambrosetti,

    Martín Gusinde, Sílvio Romero or José Veríssimo.</p>

    

    <p> However, concepts and images from both currents -objectifying

    science and empathic traditionalism- frequently overlap or

    coincide in a single symbolic environment: thus, for example, most

    of the natural science museums of the time also contain

    historical, ethnographical, and even fine arts sections; and even

    the most rigorously "scientific" geographical writing never

    refrains altogether from aestheticizing the territory of the map

    as a <em>landscape</em> that emblematises the nation.  Although it

    is possible -and even revealing- to identify the two rival

    paradigms of depiction and display with antagonistic factions of

    the elite, which are disputing hegemony, it is also true that both

    discourses, with their characteristic rhetorics and iconographies,

    fortify each other's stance: why not consider, for example, the

    interfaces between the process of historiographical

    territorialisation of the city (in particular the capital city) as

    a memory-space, a network of patriotic monuments which are

    interconnected by axis of squares and avenues whose names engrave

    a hegemonic version of national history into the very fundaments

    of the city, and the techniques of nationalising natural space

    employed by travelling geographers and cartographers, who cover

    the map with the names of the nation? Again, it seems, the

    difference between both forms of writing is one of scale: while

    the latter transforms nature into a monument, the former invents,

    on the stage of the city, a nature of monuments.</p>

    

    <p> The quote from the architect Dalmonte´s letter discussed

    above, however, is also illustrative of a process traversing the

    entire final quarter of the century, during which commercial fairs

    gradually come to replace museums as privileged sites for symbolic

    display of the nation-state.  Commodities are now taking the place

    of historical artifacts and natural specimens as fetishes of

    national identity: the nation comes to be represented not merely

    as the sum of what it contains in space and time, but it concurs,

    as a unit of production, at international contests amongst those

    belonging to "the concert of nations".  Even though the more

    immediate intention of these new representations was directed

    towards attracting investors and immigrants from overseas, they

    also contained an implicit message to a vernacular audience, one

    that was transmitted not only through the metropolitan

    correspondents of the great Latin American newspapers such as

    Darío or Gómez Carrillo, who attended and chronicled the "feasts

    of progress", but more particularly through those exhibitions held

    at provincial, national and continental level since the 1860s (in

    other words, starting less than a decade after the beginning of

    the series of great exhibitions at London's world's fair of

    1852). These events, then, present us with a heterogeneous corpus

    of artifacts, images and texts where it is possible to read a

    dialogue -or, in more mercantile terms, a competition- between

    those representations of Latin America forged by and for a local

    elite audience, and those mounted in the imperial centres

    overseas.</p>

    

    <p> A quite telling example of this dialogue and competition can

    be found in the Brazilian pavilion of the Parisian exhibition of

    1889: designed by the French architect Louis Dauvergne, in the

    kind of eclectic exoticism so common to a great portion of

    monumental architecture of the era (it cited, curiously enough,

    elements of Hispanic Moorish and colonial architecture), this

    exhibition palace contained two altogether different

    exhibitions. On the ground floor, a collection of woods, minerals,

    fibres, fruits and other raw materials was displayed in an

    Arcadian environment designed by various French artists, and

    susciting Rousseaunian images of a virginal and prodigious nature

    still to be explored and exploited by European capital and

    immigration. The upper floors, however, designed by Brazilians,

    contained manufactured products, scientific and literary

    publications, furniture and works of art, which jointly suggested

    a modest but nevertheless firm strife towards modernity and

    refinement. Needless to say, the majority of European commentators

    of the exhibition preferred the ground floor, which appeared to

    them as more "authentically Brazilian".</p>

    

    <p> As Timothy Mitchell has suggested, <em>fin-de-siècle</em>

    culture forges an image of the world as exhibition, where

    everything falls subject to an essentially visual pattern, which

    at the same time ensures the fundamental disponibility of objects,

    messages, and human beings. This world-object, at the same time,

    is subjected to a point of view endowed with authority, a

    subject-position that not by chance coincides, geographically and

    historically, with the place of Empire. On the Latin American

    periphery, this imperial gaze is reconstructed, on a smaller

    scale, in the form of the nation-as-exhibition. These new

    representations of the nation-self, in coincidence with a moment

    of state consolidation, constitute in many ways a point of

    departure for a kind of communication between the State and the

    new, modern masses which, given the lack of any real

    performativity on the level of politics and culture, remains

    largely of an imaginary and fetishistic character.</p>

    

    <p> One last reflection on the role of literature and of criticism

    in this context of national iconographies. Even though writing

    partakes actively in the fetishizing of certain images of

    nationhood, some literary and essayistic works written between

    1880 and the end of the century can, at the same time, provide the

    clues for a deconstruction of the fetishistic

    arrangement. Literary, historical and scientific texts not only

    form part of the staging of the national at exhibitions and

    museums, as material evidence of the immaterial, but many

    historical and travel narratives of the late nineteenth century

    furthermore adopt the order of the exhibition as a structural

    device of literary composition. It is for this very reason, we

    could argue, that these narratives which Philippe Hamon has

    described as "warehouse-texts", at the same time as they forge

    national symbolic environments in space and in time, allow us a

    glimpse of the way in which visibility and disponibility are

    manufactured.  Facing the predominantly visual and exhibitionist

    symbolic order of the late nineteenth century, writing somewhat

    ironically becomes a critical tool, one of the keys to access the

    invisible.</p>
