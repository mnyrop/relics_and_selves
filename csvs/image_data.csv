One of the first photographic landscapes on paper (rather than using the more familiar daguerrotype), in the making of this image the slightly lighter machinery permitted the photographer to approach his subject more closely, yet it also required quick and skilfull handling of wet negatives.  Stahl had asked a young black local to pose fro him on the rocks closest to the waterfall –an extremely dangerous stunt – to give an idea of proportion.  The image was plagiated in 1868 by Augusto Riedel in his album recording the Duke of Saxony’s journey across Brazil, inserting the figure of a white leisure traveller contemplating the falls instead of Stahl’s young black.

Agassiz published an account of the journey, co-scripted with his wife, Elizabeth Carey, which was illustrated with several lithographies reproducing photographs by Stahl (cf. A Journey in Brazil, by Prof. And Mrs. Louis Agassiz.  Boston:  Ticknor & Fields, 1868).  Among these were four portraits of female slaves and two views of Rio de Janeiro’s botanical garden.  Also on request from Agassiz, Stahl took a series of photographs of blacks and Chinese immigrants, all of which repeated the standardised front, profile and rear view common to physiological photography of the time.  None of these images were included in the book on Brazil, but rather seemed to have been taken for a forthcoming comparative study of the human races.  Agassiz, however, included physiological typologies of the races in his travel book, such as this characterisation of blacks:  “of long arms, the Negroes are generally slim; they have long legs and a relatively short torso; the shoulderblades are long and stand close to one another, the back is slightly wrinkled and slender; the hands disproportionably slim, with the interdigital furrows more prolonged than in any other race.""
